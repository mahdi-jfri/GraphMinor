# Graph Minors XVII, (13.1)

We prove (13.1) (page 202) from XVI (3.1). The route is the paper's. Given a graph `H`, we apply (3.1). If `G` has no minor controlled by the tangle, then (3.1) gives a set `Z` of few vertices and a
central segregation of `G \ Z` of type `(ρ, κ)` with a proper arrangement in a surface in which `H` cannot be drawn. The arrangement gives a portrayal, by `exists_portrayal_of_arrangement`.

There is one change. The minors of (3.1) use edges of `G`, and those of XVII use edges of the simple graph `G*`. If `H` has loops or parallel edges, then a minor in the first sense need not give a
minor in the second. So we apply (3.1) to the double subdivision of `H`, which is simple. A minor of it gives a minor of `H` in `G*` (`controlsMinor_of_subdiv`), and if it cannot be drawn in a surface
then `H` cannot either (`canBeDrawnIn_subdiv`).
