# Maps between closed discs with a fixed part of the boundary

We build the homeomorphism behind the step "Then `Γ'` is a painting in `Σ'`" of the proof of (9.3) of Graph Minors XVII, page 184.
Let `Q` and `Q'` be closed discs with boundaries `K ∪ G` and `K ∪ E`, for lines `G` and `E` with the same ends as `K`. Then there
is a homeomorphism of `Q` onto `Q'` that fixes `K`, maps `G` onto `E`, and maps a given inner point of `G` to a given inner point of
`E` (`exists_disc_map`). The boundary map extends over the discs by the Schoenflies theorem.
