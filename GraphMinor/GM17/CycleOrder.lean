# Order around a circle that is cut into lines

An `O`-arc is cut into connected pieces `F i`, where `F i` joins the point `nd i` to the next point and has no other point `nd j`. If a set `I` of
indices is an interval of `0, 1, ...` then, for four points in order around the arc, if the first and third have index in `I`, so does the second or
the fourth (`mem_of_inOrderOn`). This gives (P7) in XVII (13.1).

The proof uses any parametrization of the arc that shows the four points in order. The first and third points cut it into two closed arcs. A piece
that avoids the two points lies in one of the two arcs. So all the points outside the interval between the first and third are on the same arc.
