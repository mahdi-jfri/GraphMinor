# One chord for each pair of a clique of nodes

This file builds the graph used in Claim (1) of the proof of (12.2) of Graph Minors XVII (page 198). Let `M` be a set of nodes in which every two nodes lie on a common cell. The paper joins each pair by an arc of `bd(c̄)`. Such an arc lies in `U(Γ)`, so a cycle of them is not `Γ`-normal. We push each arc into the region beside it (`exists_chords`), which gives lines with the same ends that are `Γ`-normal, and that are still disjoint off their ends.

Each chord has two sides near each of its inner points (`IsChordSide`). This is what we use in place of "`H` is drawn in `Σ`".
