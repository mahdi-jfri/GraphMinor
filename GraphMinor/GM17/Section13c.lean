# Graph Minors XVII, Section 13: a redundant portrayal

This file states (13.1) of Robertson and Seymour, *Graph Minors. XVII. Taming a Vortex*, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 77 (1999), 162-210, for graphs. The refinement (13.4) is proved in `Section13Proved`.

- `Theorem131Statement`: the statement of (13.1) (page 202), for graphs.

(13.4) is proved in `Section13Proved` by the paper's argument, with `a*`, `b*` as on page 207. Truth comes from `exists_true_resembling`.

/-- **Graph Minors XVII, (13.1)** (page 202), for graphs: "For any graph $H$ there are numbers $p$, $q$, $z$ and $\theta > z$, such that for every hypergraph $G$ and every tangle $\mathcal{T}$ in $G$ of order $\ge \theta$, either (i) $\mathcal{T}$ controls an $H$-minor of $G^*$, or (ii) there exists $Z \subseteq V(G)$ with $|Z| \le z$ and a $\mathcal{T} \setminus Z$-central portrayal $\pi = (\Sigma, \Gamma, \alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ of $G \setminus Z$ with warp $\le p$, such that $\Sigma$ has $\le q$ cuffs and $H$ cannot be drawn in $\Sigma$."

The paper says "hypergraph", but its proof starts from "every graph", and (13.4) and (14.2) use it only for graphs. -/
