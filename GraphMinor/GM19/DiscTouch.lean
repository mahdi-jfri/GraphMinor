# A smaller disc that touches the boundary in given points

Let `D` be a closed disc and let `N` be a finite nonempty subset of its boundary. Then `D` holds a closed disc that meets the boundary of `D` exactly in `N`. In the unit disc we take the convex hull of `N` and a smaller disc. The
hull meets the unit circle only in `N`, since a segment between two points of the closed unit disc lies in the open disc except at its ends.

The proof of (15.2) applies this to the disc of a cuff and to the disc of an edge of size 3.
