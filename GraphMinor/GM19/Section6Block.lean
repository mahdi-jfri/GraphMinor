# Graph Minors XIX, (6.7): `sk(Γ)` is a block

Let `Γ` be an internally 3-connected painting. The paper's proof, page 342, shows that the closed curve
tracing the perimeter of a region has no repeated vertices, and then finds that a vertex that cuts
`sk(Γ)` would have to cut such a curve.

A repeated vertex would give two spokes to the hub of the region with the same ends, and these bound a
disc that misses `sk(Γ)` except at the vertex, which condition (iv) of a radial drawing forbids
(`spoke_once`). For a region of `Γ` in `Σ̂` the disc is `pinch`, which is where internal
3-connectivity is used, and for the inside of an edge of size 3 it comes from `pinch_of_cell`. So each
region has a perimeter as in `exists_perimeter`. A set of vertices closed under adjacency off a vertex
`v` that meets the closure of a region holds all vertices other than `v` in that closure
(`sk_region_part`), and since `Σ̂ \ v` is connected this gives all vertices other than `v`
(`conn_of_regions`).
