# Graph Minors XIX, (15.2): the tangle in `sk(Γ)`

The proof of (15.2) passes from `𝒯` to a tangle `𝒯'` in `sk(Γ)` by (14.1) of Graph Minors XVII. The paper's `sk(Γ)` has an edge
between any two ends of an edge of `Γ`, and we check this for the boundary of a disc (`exists_skEdge_of_mem_tilde`). The result used
later is `TangleDatum.isTangle_skTangle`.
