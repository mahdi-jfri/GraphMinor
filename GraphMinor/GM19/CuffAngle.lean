# Angles on a cuff

To speak of the order of edges around a cuff we read the cuff through the angle map `cuffPoint f` for a homeomorphism `f` from the circle.
`exists_angle_of_line` picks `f` so that a given line in the cuff has the angles from `0` to `π`. The result on connected sets is
`arc_of_preconnected`: a connected subset of the cuff holds one of the two arcs between two of its points.
