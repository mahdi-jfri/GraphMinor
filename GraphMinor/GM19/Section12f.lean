# Graph Minors XIX, Section 12: three vertices on the boundary of a wheel

The proof of (13.1) says that `bd(W)` has at least six vertices of `Γ*`. The paper gives one line for this. Here is the
proof. If at most two vertices of `Γ` lie on `bd(W)`, then internal 3-connectivity gives a disc `Δ ⊆ Σ` with this
boundary and no other vertex of `Γ`. The disc `W` has a vertex inside, so `W ≠ Δ`, and `W ∪ Δ = Σ̂`. By the first condition
in the definition of a wheel, `W` is the inside of its boundary circuit. So the tangle has a member `(A, B)` with
`V(A) = V(Γ)`, against the third tangle axiom.

The result is `TangleDatum.three_le_ncard_bd`, and it also gives the frame `Φ'` of page 377 its vertices.
