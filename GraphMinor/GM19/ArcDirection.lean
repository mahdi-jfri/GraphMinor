# Directions along a cuff

A side of a frame on a cuff, and a border edge inside it, are both open arcs of the cuff. If we read both
in the same sense, then the direction of the edge agrees with the direction of the side, in the sense of
`DirAgrees`. This file proves that, for either sense, and that an arc inside an arc can be shifted by a
multiple of `2π` to have its angles between those of the larger arc.
