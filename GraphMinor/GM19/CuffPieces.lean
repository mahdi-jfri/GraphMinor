# Cutting the boundary at a finite set

When we cut a surface, the new boundary carries a finite set `N` of vertices. If every cuff has at least
two points of `N`, then `bd(Σ) \ N` has finitely many arc-wise components, and each is an open arc of a
cuff with two different ends in `N`. This is what makes the boundary of a fragment into the border
edges of a painting.
