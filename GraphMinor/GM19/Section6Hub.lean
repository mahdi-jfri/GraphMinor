# Graph Minors XIX, proof of (6.7): the perimeter of a region

Let `D` be a drawing with no loops in a connected closed surface, with a radial drawing `G₃`. The
spokes at the vertex `c` of `G₃` in a region `r` of `D` come in a cyclic order, and two consecutive
spokes end at the two ends of an edge of `D` (`GM11.corner_data`). If each vertex of `D` has only one
spoke to `c`, then this cyclic sequence runs through the vertices in the closure of `r`, each once
(`exists_perimeter`). This is the statement of the paper's proof of (6.7), page 342, that the closed
curve tracing the perimeter of `r` has no repeated vertices.

A cyclic sequence without one term is still connected (`perimeter_avoid`), and this is the step
"which is impossible" of that proof.
