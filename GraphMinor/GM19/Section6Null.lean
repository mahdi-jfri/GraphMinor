# Null-homotopic curves under a collapse

Let `c` be a homotopy from the identity of a space to a map `φ`. If `φ ∘ ψ` is null-homotopic for a closed curve `ψ` then so is `ψ` (`null_of_collapse`). If two arcs with common ends only are mapped by `φ` to two loops at one point, and both loops are null-homotopic, then the `O`-arc made of the two arcs is null-homotopic (`not_null_of_two_arcs`). These two facts are the topology behind "`rep(H) ≤ rep(H')`" in the proof of Graph Minors XIX, (6.3) (page 340).
