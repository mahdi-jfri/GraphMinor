# The outside of a disc near a point of its boundary

Let `Δ` be a closed disc in a surface and let `y` be a point of its boundary that lies off the boundary of the
surface. Near `y` the complement of `Δ` is connected. The disc itself may touch the boundary of the surface
elsewhere, so we pass to a small part of `Δ` near `y`, and use a collar around that part.
