# A chord that passes along an inner disc

Let `D₀` lie inside the closed disc `D₁`. A straight line of a chart of `D₁` through a point inside `D₀` leaves `D₀` for the last time at
two boundary points of `D₀`. The two outer pieces of this line and one arc of the boundary of `D₀` form a chord of `D₁`. So `D₁` has a
closed subdisc `Δ` that holds `D₀`, shares an arc of its boundary with `D₀`, and shares an arc of its boundary with `D₁`
(`exists_nested_chord`). This links the direction of the boundary of `D₀` to the direction of the boundary of `D₁`, in the proof of
`FragmentOrientationStatement`.
