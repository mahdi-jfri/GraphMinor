# The free end of an arc in a disc can be reached

An arc in the closed unit disc goes from the centre to the boundary, and is otherwise in the open disc. We find a second arc from the
centre to the boundary that meets the first only at the centre. The map `z ↦ z²` unfolds the first arc: its preimage is a chord of the
disc through the centre, invariant under `z ↦ -z`. A chord of one of the two half discs, from the centre to the boundary, goes down to
the second arc, because `z ↦ z²` is one to one on an open half disc (`exists_access`).
