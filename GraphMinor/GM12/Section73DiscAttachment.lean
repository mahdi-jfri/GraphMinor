# Attachment points of disc pieces

Two disc pieces of a tie meet, if at all, in a single point.
That point belongs to the boundary of both discs. A connected
set with more than one point has no isolated point, so neither
disc can meet the interior of the other at their sole common
point. Once their boundary circuits lie in a drawing, their
common point must be a vertex: an interior point of a common
edge would force more than that point into their intersection.
These facts let the tie walk in XII (7.3), page 262, concatenate
the two boundary walks at their attachment.
