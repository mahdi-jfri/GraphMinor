# Respectfulness for circles missing the vertex in XII (7.2)

Divert a circle off the removed disc by a homeomorphism fixing the
outside drawing. The diverted circle is normal for the old drawing
and meets exactly the same vertices. Respectfulness gives its inside
disc. Pull that disc back. Since the outside drawing is fixed, its
separation is unchanged and belongs to the restricted tangle.
