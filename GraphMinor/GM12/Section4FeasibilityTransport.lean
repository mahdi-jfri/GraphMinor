# Carrying feasible discs by a homeomorphism

In XII (4.3), claim (7), page 251, the vertex discs of a
drawing of the target graph are carried to the selected ends by
a homeomorphism of the surface. Homeomorphisms preserve the
discs, their disjointness, and their exact intersections with the
prescribed disc family. This file gives the transport calculation.
