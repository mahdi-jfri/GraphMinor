# The edges of the replacement paths

In XII (7.3), page 261, a new spoke at the merged hub is replaced
by the old surviving spoke and the star spoke to its old region
hub. Record these old edges from their incidence and image data.
When the star spokes are unique, every two-edge lift with the
required image contains these edges.
