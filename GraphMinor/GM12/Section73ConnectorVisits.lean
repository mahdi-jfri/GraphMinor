# Visit counts after joining two pieces

In XII (7.3), page 262, XI (9.2) supplies walks around two
pieces and a connector. Replace the connector by a shortest path
between their vertex sets. It meets either piece only at the
corresponding end. Interior vertices of the connector contribute
at most two visits and none from the pieces. At an end there is
at most one visit from the connector and one from its piece.
If the path has zero length, the two piece walks alone contribute
at most two visits.
