# A radial subdrawing for the original disc restriction

In XII (7.2), page 260, the two-spoke trace either backtracks, in
which case no old drawing point is removed, or gives a boundary
circuit with the same old inside and outside. In the second case use
the proved radial deletion. In both cases the new radial drawing is
a subdrawing of the old one and retains the old region's hub.
