# A rectangle around a compact straight arc

For XII (4.3), claim (7), page 251, motions along arcs must have
support in an assigned open set. A compact real interval in an open
plane set has a thin rectangular neighborhood in that set. The
rectangle extends beyond both ends, so a strip slide can move one
end to the other.
