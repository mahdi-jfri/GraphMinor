# Transferring a thin disc through an arc chart

The empty discs in XII (4.3), page 250, follow from a thin disc
around a normal arc. In a strip chart, the arc is a real interval.
Rescale that interval to `[-1, 1]` and apply the plane construction.
The chart is injective, so it carries the resulting disc and its
two boundary ends back to the surface without new intersections.
