# Straightness of a subdivided edge near its meeting

For XII (4.5), page 253, the original edge agrees with its
supporting line inside the open unit disc. Near a meeting, the
subdivision piece containing that meeting agrees with the old
edge. Intersect these two neighborhoods to obtain the local
straight-line model for the subdivision piece itself.

/-- A subdivision piece is locally its chord's complete
supporting line at its unique meeting in the open unit disc.
This supplies the straightness needed to choose crossing discs
for the subdivided drawing in XII (4.5), page 253. -/
