# Determining the image of a circuit from its vertices and edges

For XII (7.3), Claim (1), page 262, identify the collapsed old
circuit with the new circuit. It suffices to check vertices and
open edges. Continuity handles the old edge closures, and the
compactness of the old drawing makes its image closed, so the
new edge closures are included as well.
