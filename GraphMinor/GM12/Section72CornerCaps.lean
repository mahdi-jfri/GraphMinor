# Small discs in corners for the local diversion in XII (7.2)

A corner between two half-edges has a small closed disc whose boundary
contains an initial part of each half-edge. The disc meets the drawing
only in those two initial parts. These discs allow a diversion near the
boundary vertex while keeping the outside drawing fixed.
