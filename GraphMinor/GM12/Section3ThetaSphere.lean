# Three theta discs covering the surface force a sphere

The third schismatic shape in VII Section 8, used by XII (3.1), page
245, occurs only on a sphere with three cuffs. For the sphere assertion,
fill the cuffs and consider its three enclosing discs. Two pair circles
are planar, so VII (5.1) puts the whole proper theta in one disc. On a
surface other than a sphere, uniqueness of bounded discs then puts all
three enclosing discs in that disc. They cannot cover a closed surface.
