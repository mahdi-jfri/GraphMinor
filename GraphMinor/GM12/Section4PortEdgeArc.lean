# Joining the outer pieces to an inner chord

An edge of the crossing drawing in XII (4.5), page 253, consists
of two outer vertex pieces and one inner chord. Each outer piece
meets the chord at its own port. When the outer pieces lie in
disjoint vertex neighborhoods, their union with the chord is a
simple arc. Its intersection with the unit disc is exactly the
inner chord.
