# Graph walks under homeomorphisms of drawings

In the reduction of XII (3.1), page 245, VII supplies a forest up to
homoplasty. Its boundary-fixing homeomorphism preserves connectivity.
Map every edge and vertex of a walk through the homeomorphism. Mapping
back by the inverse gives the converse, so the boundary connection
classes are unchanged.
