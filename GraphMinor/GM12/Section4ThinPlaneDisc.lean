# A thin disc avoiding a closed set except at its ends

For the empty-disc construction in XII (4.3), page 250,
straighten a normal arc to a real segment. The distance from each
interior point of the segment to the forbidden closed set gives
a positive width. This width tends to zero at the ends. Shrinking
the vertical fibres of the unit disc by that width produces the
required disc within the prescribed open chart.

/-- A real segment whose interior misses a closed set can be thickened
into a disc meeting that set only at its ends, within any open set
containing the segment. -/
