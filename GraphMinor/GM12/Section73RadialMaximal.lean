# Maximality of the cleaned radial contraction

For XII (7.3), page 261, extend the cleaned pre-radial drawing to a
radial drawing using the finite spoke bound. If an edge was added,
it splits one old disc face into two regions of the extension. Each
new radial region contains an original drawing edge. Those edges
would lie in the same old face, contradicting the edge-uniqueness
condition retained during cleanup. Hence no edge was added.
