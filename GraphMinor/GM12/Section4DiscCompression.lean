# Compressing a disc inside an assigned neighborhood

For XII (4.3), claim (7), page 251, a source disc can be made small
before it is moved into its assigned target disc. Give the source a
collar avoiding the protected closed set. A radial change inside the
collar compresses the disc into any neighborhood of its center and
fixes the protected set pointwise.
