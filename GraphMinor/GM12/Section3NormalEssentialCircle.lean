# A normal essential circle outside one disc

For the one-cuff minimum-existence step used by XII (3.1), page 245,
add the deleted disc's normal boundary to the drawing. Its complement
is the closure of a union of regions. This complement is not planar:
on a surface other than the sphere, a containing disc would also
contain the deleted disc, and hence fill the whole closed surface.
The normal-circle criterion VII (5.5), page 231, therefore supplies a
normal circle in the complement which is not null-homotopic.

/-- On a closed surface other than the sphere, the complement of one
