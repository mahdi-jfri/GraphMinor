# Two planar pair circles determine the third homotopy

For the three-branch shape in VII Section 8, used by XII (3.1), page
245, two pair circles lying in discs make their common branch homotopic
to each other branch. Transitivity makes the other two branches
homotopic. Traversing one and returning along the other therefore
gives a null-homotopic third circle. This spells out the path argument
behind the planarity comparisons for the third schismatic shape.
