# An isolated arc end has a ray chart

For the leaf-entry patch on XII page 243, remove the other edges and
the far part of the incident edge from a neighbourhood of the leaf.
The drawing there is exactly the initial part of one arc. Straight
coordinates identify this arc with an increasing real interval.
Restrict the chart to points before its far endpoint and to the chosen
neighbourhood. The drawing is then exactly the positive real ray,
so the slit-patch construction applies.
