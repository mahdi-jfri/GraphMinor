# The minimal chord in the second case of XII (2.1)

On page 244, the proof joins two components of the curve in one region
and takes a minimal line between them. Along an arc joining two disjoint
closed sets, first take the first point of the second set, then the last
point of the first set before it. The open segment between these points
misses both sets. Applied to one component and the union of the others,
this gives the required minimal line.

/-- Along a continuous curve from one disjoint closed set to another,
there is an interval with its ends in the two sets and its interior
outside both. Only closedness of their parameter preimages is needed. -/
