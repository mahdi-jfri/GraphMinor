# Transporting contact partitions between homeomorphic spaces

The small-surface reduction for XII (4.5) must retain its
vertex-disc witnesses and exact endpoint classes. A homeomorphism
carries discs and disjointness to their images, and its image
commutes with intersections and unions. The class of image ends
is the image of the old end class. Boundary parametrizations
transport by composition with the same homeomorphism.
