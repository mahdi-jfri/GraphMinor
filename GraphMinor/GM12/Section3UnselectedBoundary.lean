# A free set outside an unselected disc bounds its boundary

For the one-disc sphere case of XII (3.2), pages 247--248, take a
disc which is not a small side of the tangle. If its boundary has
at least the tangle order, the free-set size bound suffices. Otherwise
the first tangle axiom selects the reverse separation. Freeness of
the prescribed vertices on that reverse side bounds them by the
separation order, which is at most the boundary vertex count.
