# Joining source discs while preserving boundary contacts

In the source feasibility construction of XII (4.5), claim (1),
page 253, the thin discs around residual edge halves are joined
to their vertex discs. When two discs meet at one boundary point,
round their union in a neighborhood of that point. Choose the
neighborhood inside a prescribed open set and away from the
closed set of crossing discs. This keeps all contacts with that
closed set, including their boundary status.

/-- Joining two discs at a boundary point preserves their exact
contacts with any closed set avoiding that point. The joined
disc stays inside a prescribed open neighborhood. This is used
to thicken the vertex stars in XII (4.5), claim (1), page 253. -/
