# The order bound for the spliced circuit separation

In XII (7.3), Claim (1), page 262, the old circuit has either
the new circuit's length or two more edges. In the latter case
the deleted vertex lies on the old circuit. It is already in
both sides of the old disc separation, so adjoining it does not
raise the order. In both cases X (2.9) therefore selects the
disc separation in the deleted tangle.

/-- The selected inside of the spliced old circuit gives a selected
disc separation in the deleted tangle. This proves the order and
orientation calculation for the hub case of XII (7.3), Claim (1),
page 262. The parameter `n` is the new circuit's length. -/
