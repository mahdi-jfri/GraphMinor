# A local rerouting that preserves homotopy

The circle-intersection step of the Section 8 argument used by XII
(3.1), page 245, needs a finite graph inside the original solid set.
On a short path piece, take its first and last contacts with a closed
set whose part in the patch is arc-connected. Replace the portion
between those contacts by a path in that set. Both paths stay in a
simply connected patch, so the replacement preserves the homotopy.
The two retained outer portions have no other contacts with the set.
