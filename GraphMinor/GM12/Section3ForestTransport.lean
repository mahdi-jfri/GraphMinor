# Forests under inclusion of a closed subspace

The auxiliary-disc step in XII (3.2), page 247, reads the same
forest in a smaller surface. An injective map of vertices and edges
preserves simple closed walks and their lengths. Thus a forest in
the ambient surface stays a forest when its support is read in a
subspace. The walk transport also keeps boundary connections.
