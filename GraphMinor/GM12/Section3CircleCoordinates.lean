# Straight coordinates near a circle boundary

For the local surface charts needed by XII (3.1), page 245, subtract
the height of the right semicircle from the real coordinate. This is
a homeomorphism of the plane. Near the point one, it sends the outside
of the unit disc to the right half-plane and the circle to its boundary
line. Rotation supplies the same coordinates at every circle point.
