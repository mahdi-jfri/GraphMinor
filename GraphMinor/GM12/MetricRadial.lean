# The metric of a tangle does not depend on the radial drawing

Graph Minors XII, Section 1 (page 242), defines the metric $d$ of a respectful tangle from a radial
drawing $K$ of $\Gamma$, and the proof of (6.1) (page 258) chooses a special $K$. The paper does not say
that $d$ is the same for every $K$. Graph Minors XI, Section 3 (page 75), says that a radial drawing is
unique up to homeomorphisms of $\Sigma$ that fix $U(\Gamma)$, and omits the proof. We prove the fact
about $d$ that is needed, by (7.7)(ii) of XII applied with $\Gamma' = \Gamma$ (`tangleMetric_eq_of_radial`).
The proof of (7.7) uses only (1.2) and (2.1), and so it does not depend on (6.1).

* `exists_derivedSlope`: every radial drawing has a slope derived from the tangle, as on page 87 of XI.
* `inducedBySubgraph_self`: the tangle that a tangle induces in its own graph is itself.
* `HasTangleMetric.eq`: two metrics of one tangle agree on the atoms.
* `HasTangleMetric.of_radial`: so the metric may be computed in any radial drawing.

/-- **A derived slope in any radial drawing.** For a respectful tangle `T` of order `θ`, each circuit
`C` of a radial drawing with length `< 2θ` gives a `Γ`-normal `O`-arc `U(C)` with fewer than `θ`
vertices of `Γ`, so it bounds the closed disc of respectfulness (Graph Minors XI, Section 6,
page 87). -/
