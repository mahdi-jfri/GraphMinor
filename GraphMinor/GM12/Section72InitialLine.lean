# Initial sublines contain the line near its end

The small corner caps in XII (7.2) contain initial sublines of the two
circle branches. Any nontrivial subline with the same end contains its
ambient line near that end. In interval coordinates this is the
intermediate value theorem, and the rest of the interval is compact.
