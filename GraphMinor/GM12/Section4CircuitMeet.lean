# Intersections of maximal circuit insides

The circuit-chain distance calculation of XII (4.1), page 248, can be
witnessed by a closed walk along the circuit boundaries. To join those
walks, retain maximal circuit insides. Two such insides that meet have
boundaries that meet: otherwise XI (7.7) makes them nested. The second
tangle condition rules out their covering the surface. Subdrawings of one drawing
whose point sets meet have a vertex in common.
