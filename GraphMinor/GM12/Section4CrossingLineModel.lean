# Coordinates at a crossing of two chords

For XII (4.5), page 253, distinct circle ports give distinct
supporting lines. At a meeting in the open unit disc, the vectors
from the meeting to one port of each chord are nonzero. Use these
vectors as the columns of the real-linear crossing coordinates.
Both complete supporting lines are then the coordinate axes.
