# Comparing a possible empty bigon with the removed disc

For the radial condition in XII (7.2), page 260, the boundary of a
possible new empty bigon lies in the closed outside of the removed
disc. The open interior of that disc is connected and misses the
bigon's boundary. It is therefore wholly inside the bigon or wholly
outside. In the first case the whole removed disc lies in the bigon.
If the bigon misses the boundary vertex, only the second case occurs,
and the bigon already lay in the original region.
