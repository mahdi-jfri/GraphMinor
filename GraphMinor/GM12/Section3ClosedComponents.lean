# Components of a finite disjoint closed family

The punctured surface in XII (3.1), page 245, has the disc boundaries
as its cuffs. Each is connected and closed, and the finite family is
disjoint. A connected component of the union must stay in one member,
while that whole connected member belongs to the component.
