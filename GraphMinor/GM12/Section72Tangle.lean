# Restricting the tangle in Graph Minors XII, (7.2)

A normal circle through one vertex bounds a disc chosen by respectfulness.
The disc separation has order one, so XII, (7.1) restricts the tangle to the
outside drawing without lowering its order. This proves the tangle assertion
in the first part of the proof of (7.2), pages 259–260. It does not prove
that the new drawing is two-cell, or that the new tangle is respectful.
