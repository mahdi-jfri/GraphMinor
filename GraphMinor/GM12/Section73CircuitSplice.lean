# Joining the old circuit through the radial star

In XII (7.3), Claim (1), page 262, the two replaced spokes have
either the same old middle vertex or different old middle vertices.
In the first case two edges close the retained path. In the second
case four edges close it through the deleted vertex. The middle
vertices and the deleted vertex lie outside the retained path, so
both constructions give simple closed walks.

/-- The four-edge splice in XII (7.3), Claim (1), page 262,
closes the retained path into a simple closed walk. All its edges
belong to the path or the four specified spokes. -/
