# Contracting a sector at its boundary vertex

For the entry-edge existence argument on XII page 243, an incoming curve
must be compared inside one corner. In disc coordinates, the open disc
together with one boundary point is star-convex at that point. Intersecting
with a small ball preserves this property. A chart carries the resulting
contraction back to a simply-connected patch of the sector.
