# The two pieces at an internal cut

At a new vertex of the subdivision in XII (4.5), page 252,
the two adjacent pieces are portions of the same simple arc.
Any intersection is a cut, and each piece contains only its two
endpoint cuts. Injectivity of the cut map leaves exactly their
shared endpoint as the intersection.
