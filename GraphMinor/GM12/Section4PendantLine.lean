# A pendant line at an isolated target vertex

At the start of XII (4.3), page 249, an isolated target vertex
can first be given a pendant edge. Around an isolated point of a
closed set there is a chart avoiding all its other points. Draw a
short radial segment from the point in that chart. Its other end
is new, and its interior misses the closed set.
