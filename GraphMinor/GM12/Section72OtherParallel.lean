# Parallel spokes in unchanged regions

For maximality in XII (7.2), page 260, an extra spoke in an unchanged
old region misses the removed disc. It also misses the old radial
drawing in its interior, since all old radial points there survive.
Old maximality supplies a parallel spoke. Its region end is outside
the removed disc, so that spoke survives as well.
