# Visit counts for circuit walks

The walk selection in XII (7.3), page 262, uses XI (9.2) and
the six shapes of a tie. A disc boundary contributes a circuit
walk, which visits each vertex at most once. For a closed walk,
counting departures is the same as counting its support with the
first vertex removed. A simple closed walk has this latter list
without repetitions. This proves the needed circuit visit bound.
