# Selected disc separations survive vertex deletion

In XII (7.3), Claim (1), page 262, an old selected disc gives
a selected separation in the deleted tangle. First add the deleted
vertex to both sides and apply X (2.9). Deleting the vertex then
recovers exactly the intersections of the new drawing with the
same disc and its closed outside.
