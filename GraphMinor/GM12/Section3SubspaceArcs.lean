# Lines and circles in a smaller ambient space

When XII (3.1), page 245, reads its drawing in the punctured surface,
its edge closures remain lines or circles. Restricting the ambient
space to a set containing an arc does not change that arc as a
topological space. The homeomorphism is the identity on its points.
