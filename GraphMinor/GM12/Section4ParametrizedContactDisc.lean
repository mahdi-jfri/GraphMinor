# Shrinking a disc while retaining its marked parameters

For XII (4.5), page 253, replace a region closure by a smaller
disc touching its boundary only at four prescribed vertices.
Extend the given boundary parametrization to a chart of the
disc, carry the marks to the unit circle, and use the convex
contact disc there. Its radial parametrization fixes the
marks. Carrying it back retains their original parameters,
so their order is available for the four-marked disc match.

/-- A finite nonempty boundary contact set can be realized by
a smaller disc whose boundary parametrization agrees with the
original one at every contact. This prepares the ordered target
discs for XII (4.5), page 253. -/
