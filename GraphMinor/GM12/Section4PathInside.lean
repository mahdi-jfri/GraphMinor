# A path portion forces its incident edge into a circuit inside

In XII (4.3), claim (1), page 250, a path portion misses the radial
circuit and has one end in its inside. Its whole point set is then in
the interior of that inside. An original edge incident with its other
end also lies inside: it misses the radial circuit and meets the
interior near the common end.
