# The tangle after vertex deletion in Graph Minors XII, (7.3)

Deleting vertices from a drawing agrees with deleting them from its hypergraph.
Thus Graph Minors X, (8.5) supplies the tangle used at the start of the proof of
XII, (7.3), page 261. This file proves that part of the construction. Respectfulness
and the two metric bounds are separate questions.
