# Free boundary vertices give the enclosing-circle bound

To verify (3.1)(v) in the proof of XII (3.2), page 247, the enclosed
boundary vertices are free and lie on the small side selected by the
tangle. Their number is at most the separation order. The common
vertices of that separation lie on the enclosing circle, which gives
the required bound. The disc on the small side is the enclosing disc.
