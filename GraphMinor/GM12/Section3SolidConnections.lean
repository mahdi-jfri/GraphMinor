# Connections inside a connected solid set

The Section 8 argument of VII used in XII (3.1), page 245, joins its
selected circles inside the solid set. The paper's local
arc-connectedness definition gives path-connected neighbourhoods in
the subspace. Connectedness then gives paths between all its points,
and the arc-in-a-path theorem removes repeated parts of those paths.
