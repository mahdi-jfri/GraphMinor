# The complementary arc of a line in a circle

For XII (7.3), Claim (1), page 262, remove the arc of the old
circuit that is collapsed into the new hub. Its complement closes
to the other arc of that circle. Split the circle at the two
ends. The interior of the given line is connected, so it lies
in one of the two resulting arcs. A connected subset of a line
containing both ends is the whole line.
