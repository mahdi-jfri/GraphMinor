# The fixed boundary of the radial deletion

For the maximality argument in XII (7.2), page 260, the reduced old
drawing meets the removed disc only at the boundary vertex. The
retained radial drawing meets it in the retained boundary spoke.
These facts let the disc-pushing map fix both retained drawings.
An old radial edge with an end outside the disc also survives.
