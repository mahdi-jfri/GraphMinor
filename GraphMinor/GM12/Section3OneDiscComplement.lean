# The complement of one prescribed disc on the sphere

For the last case of XII (3.2), page 247, the punctured surface is
a closed disc. The sphere-disc theorem gives the disc on the other
side of the prescribed boundary circle. It is the closure of the
prescribed disc's complement, and has that same boundary circle.
Thus VI (3.6) applies to the drawing in this complementary disc.
