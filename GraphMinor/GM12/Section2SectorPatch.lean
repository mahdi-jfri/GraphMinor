# A simply-connected patch at a sector vertex

For the entry-edge construction on XII page 243, shrink a closed sector
near its boundary vertex. In disc coordinates, take the open unit disc
with that one boundary point, intersected with a small ball around the
point. It contracts to the boundary point and contains all interior
points of the sector sufficiently near the vertex.

/-- Near a boundary point of a closed disc there is a simply-connected
patch that contains the nearby disc interior and no other boundary
point. The whole patch can be kept in a prescribed neighbourhood. -/
