# Passing from a smaller trace to a larger trace

The restriction and induction steps of XII (2.1), pages 243--244, use
that the inside of a trace subdrawing is contained in the inside of
the original trace. Both insides contain their supports and the selected
insides of their circuits. A circuit of the smaller subdrawing is a
circuit of the larger one, which gives the inclusion directly.
