# A unit subdisc retaining the parameters of its contacts

For the target disc preparation of XII (4.5), page 253, take
the convex hull of the prescribed unit-circle marks and the
closed disc of radius one half. Strict convexity puts every
other point inside the unit circle. The radial boundary
parametrization fixes each prescribed mark, so their circle
parameters and cyclic order are retained.

/-- A finite nonempty set on the unit circle is exactly the
contact set of a smaller closed disc. Its boundary can be
parametrized so that each contact keeps its original circle
parameter, as needed for XII (4.5)'s target discs, page 253. -/
