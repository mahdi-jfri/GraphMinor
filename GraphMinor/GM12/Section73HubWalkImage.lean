# A visited merged hub remains in the lifted walk

At the end of XII (7.3), page 262, a new walk used for distance
to the merged region must retain the deleted vertex after lifting.
If the hub is its initial vertex this holds directly. Otherwise
split the walk at a hub visit. Its next edge has a two-edge
replacement using a star spoke, whose old endpoint is the deleted
vertex. The recorded replacement edges put that spoke in the lift.

/-- If the merged hub belongs to the point set of the new walk,
it belongs to the point set of its constructed lift. This is the
walk-point assertion used in XII (7.3)(ii), page 262. -/
