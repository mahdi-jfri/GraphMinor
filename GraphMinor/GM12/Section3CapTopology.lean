# Connectedness and the added interior of a cap

The planar criterion used in the Section 8 argument of VII applies
inside a connected cap. Adding a disc to a connected surface preserves
connectedness because the disc meets its cuff. The added disc interior
is outside the original surface, so any subset of the original surface
has proper image in the cap.
