# Small discs in crossing coordinates

In XII (4.5), page 253, a small disc is chosen around each
crossing. A translated real-linear coordinate change sends
small round discs to closed discs inside any prescribed open
neighborhood. Their boundaries are the images of the circles,
and the two coordinate lines map to the crossing lines.
