# Returning connected subdrawings from the punctured surface

XII (3.1), page 245, applies VII in Sigma-star and needs connected
subdrawings of the original drawing in Sigma. Inclusion of the closed
subspace maps edges and graph walks, preserves connectedness and vertex
disjointness, and preserves the prescribed intersections with the
boundary vertex set. This file proves that final ambient transfer.
