# Boundary contacts for locally straight crossing arcs

The source edges of XII (4.5), page 253, agree with straight
chords near each crossing. The part of a chord inside the open
unit disc agrees with its whole line. A sufficiently small
coordinate disc therefore meets each of the actual edge arcs
at the same two opposite boundary marks as its supporting line.
