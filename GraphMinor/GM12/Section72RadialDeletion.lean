# Deleting the radial pieces inside the boundary circuit

XII (7.2), page 260, deletes the radial vertices and edges strictly
inside the two-spoke circuit and then deletes one boundary spoke.
Restriction to the closed outside performs the first deletion. Since
the boundary is a subdrawing, it cuts no edge. The lemmas here record
the exact vertices, edges, and point set of this construction.
