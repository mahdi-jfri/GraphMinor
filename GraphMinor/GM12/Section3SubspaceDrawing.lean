# Reading a drawing in a subspace containing its support

For XII (3.1), page 245, the original drawing is also a graph in the
punctured surface. Pull its support and vertex set back along inclusion.
Its edges are the same arc-components, and their closures remain lines
or circles with the same endpoints. This constructs that drawing without
adding any geometric assumption beyond containment of its support.
