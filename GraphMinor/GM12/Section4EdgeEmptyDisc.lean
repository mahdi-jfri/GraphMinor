# A disc meeting the drawing only at the ends of an edge

XII (4.3), page 250, chooses an empty disc through the two
ends of each free edge. Choose a region incident with the edge,
join its two ends through that region, and thicken the resulting
normal arc. The disc meets that same region, and no other region
meets the disc. This also identifies the incident region needed
for the metric estimate in claim (5).
