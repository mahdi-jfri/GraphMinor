# Adding a normal circle to a drawing

In the one-cuff candidate-existence argument used by XII (3.1),
page 245, add the prescribed disc boundary to the drawing. Mark every
original vertex on the circle and one additional circle point. The
circle drawing then meets the original drawing only at common
vertices, so their union is a drawing. Any set normal to this union
is normal to the original drawing as well.
