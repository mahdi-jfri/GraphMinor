# A short radial circuit enclosing an edge

The edge--region distance estimate in XII (4.3), claim (5),
page 250, can be witnessed around the edge. Put the edge and its
ends on the small side of their separation, whose order is at most
two. The third tangle axiom chooses this orientation. XII (1.1)
then gives a radial circuit enclosing the edge with at most two
original vertices.
