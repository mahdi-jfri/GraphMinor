# A minimal line between components of a closed set in a region

In Case 2 of XII (2.1), page 244, the intersection of the circle with
a region is not connected. Separate that relatively closed set into
two closed pieces, join points of those pieces through the region,
and select the gap between the last point of the first piece and the
first point of the second. Its ends belong to different components.

/-- The minimal line required in Case 2 of XII (2.1), page 244, exists
in any path-connected region where the intersection with the closed
curve is disconnected. No finiteness of its components is needed. -/
