# Shared atoms miss the merged region

For XII (7.3)(i), page 262, an atom shared by the old and
deleted drawings misses the merged region. Otherwise it would
equal that region as a new atom. Since it contains the deleted
vertex, its old atom would then be just that vertex. An open
disc cannot be a singleton: it contains a closed disc with an
infinite boundary circle.
