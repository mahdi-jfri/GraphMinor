# Distinct incident edges from distinct corner regions

In the base case of XII (7.4), pages 262--263, a non-loop
incident edge has just one half-edge at the vertex. If some
other edge had two half-edges there, distinct corner regions
force those half-edges to be each other's successors. The cyclic
order would then consist only of those two half-edges, contrary
to the non-loop edge. Thus every incident edge occurs once in
the corner order, as required by the finite gluing.
