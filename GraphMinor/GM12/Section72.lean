# Graph Minors XII, (7.2)

Restrict a respectful drawing tangle to the closed outside of its
selected disc bounded by a normal circle through one vertex. The
merged region is an open disc, and every lost atom is at distance at
most one from that vertex. Diversion proves respectfulness of the
restricted tangle. A radial subdrawing with the old region's hub
then gives both metric comparisons by lifting closed walks.

/-- Graph Minors XII, (7.2), pages 259–260. Deleting the selected
inside of a normal circle through one vertex preserves the order of
the respectful tangle. Distances between shared atoms, and distances
from shared atoms to the enlarged region, do not decrease. -/
