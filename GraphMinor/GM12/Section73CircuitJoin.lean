# Joining the boundary walks of disc pieces

The two-disc tie in XII (7.3), page 262, is enclosed by joining
the two circuit walks at their common vertex. Each circuit walk
visits a vertex at most once, so their concatenation visits it at
most twice. Their edges are disjoint, since the circuits meet in
only one point. Their total length is therefore bounded by the
length of any walk containing both circuits.
