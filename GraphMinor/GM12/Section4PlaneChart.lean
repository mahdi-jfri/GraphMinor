# Putting the planar source configuration in a surface chart

The proof of XII (4.5), page 252, first constructs its crossing
drawing in the plane and then in the surface. The plane is
homeomorphic to an open unit disc. Compose this homeomorphism
with the inverse of a chart at any point of the closed surface.
The result is an open embedding, so all arc, disc, intersection,
and local crossing data can be carried into the surface.
