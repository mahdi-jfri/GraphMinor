# Two discs meeting once meet on both boundaries

For XII (3.1)(iii) in the proof of (3.2), page 246, the two boundary
circles need a common base point. If a single intersection point
were interior to one disc, its intersection with the other disc
would be a relatively open singleton. That other disc is connected
and has another point, so this singleton cannot also be relatively
closed. Thus the point lies on both boundaries.
