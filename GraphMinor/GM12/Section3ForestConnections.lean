# Boundary vertices and connections of feasible forests

The reduction of XII (3.1), page 245, uses a forest feasible by VII
(7.5). Forest homotopy preserves its boundary vertex set and which
boundary vertices are connected. The definition uses simple paths;
removing repeated vertices from a walk gives the same connection
relation for arbitrary walks. A homeomorphism fixing the boundary
also preserves the boundary vertex set.
