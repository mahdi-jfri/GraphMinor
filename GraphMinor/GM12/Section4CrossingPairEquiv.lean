# The bijection between edges and crossing pairs

In XII (4.5), page 253, the edges of the subdivided source fall
into crossing pairs. Give each crossing its two incident edges.
Every edge has exactly one crossing, so two crossings cannot
supply the same edge. Conversely each edge is supplied by the
two-edge pair at its unique crossing. This gives the actual
bijection used to index the external paths by source edges.

/-- Edges with one crossing each are in bijection with the two
positions at every crossing. The map sends the two positions
to the two incident edges, as used to reindex the external
