# Edge lines under a contraction map

In XII (7.3), page 261, contracting one radial edge preserves the
other edge lines when the contraction is injective on each of their
closures. Parameterize a line, compose with the map, and use the
resulting embedded interval. Compactness also lets the image commute
with taking an edge closure.
