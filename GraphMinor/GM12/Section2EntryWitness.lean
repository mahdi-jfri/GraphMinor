# Entry witnesses and replacement across a parallel disc

In XII's entry definition on page 243, a normalized approach followed
by an edge parametrization gives the required entry curve. A path
homotopy in the region with its vertex added gives the stated curve
homotopy. The second lemma replaces a chord by a parallel spoke using
the disc between them.
