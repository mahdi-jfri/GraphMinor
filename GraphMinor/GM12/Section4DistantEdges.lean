# The two distant edges at the start of XII (4.3)

A tangle of order at least three requires at least two drawing
edges. Otherwise the small side consisting of its only edge would
cover every edge, contrary to X (2.3). Thus the corrected edge-count
hypothesis of XII (1.2) holds in the application on page 249.
Applying (1.2) to any edge supplies the two distant edges.
