# The leaf entry patch

The omitted entry-edge lemma of XII, page 243, requires the incoming
curve and spoke to be compared in the incident region with the leaf
restored. The slit patch at the unique incident edge has a connected
puncture off the drawing. Since the leaf is in the region's closure,
that puncture meets the region and therefore lies wholly in it. This
proves the patch statement at leaves, including its local coverage.
