# Parameterizing a disc boundary punctured at one point

The leaf gluing in XII (7.4), pages 262--263, uses a disc whose
boundary misses the old region at just one point. Regard its
boundary circle as a loop drawing with that point as its sole
vertex. The edge parameter then runs through every other boundary
point injectively in the open parameter interval, and starts and
ends at the missing point.
