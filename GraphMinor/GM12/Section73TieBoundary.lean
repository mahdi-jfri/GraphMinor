# Boundaries of the pieces of a tie

The walk selection in XII (7.3), page 262, uses the ties of XI
(9.2). Their disc and line pieces meet only at finitely many
attachment points. Away from these points, a boundary of a piece
is on the boundary of the union. A line or circle is the closure
of itself with finitely many points removed. Thus a closed set
containing the boundary of the union contains these boundaries
at the attachment points too.
