# Local image coverage from neighbourhoods of a fibre

For the positive-length trace restriction in XII (2.1), pages 243--244,
all sufficiently near curve-image points come from neighbourhoods of
the parameters mapping to the chosen vertex. The complement of those
parameter neighbourhoods is compact. Its image is closed and misses
the vertex, so deleting that image gives the required neighbourhood.
This lets finitely many entering and leaving corner germs control
the whole curve image near the vertex.
