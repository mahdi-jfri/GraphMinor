# Extending the boundary map used in XII (7.2)

A continuous bijection between the boundaries of two closed discs extends
to a continuous bijection of the discs. In disc coordinates, the boundary
map is a homeomorphism of the unit circle. Schoenflies extends it to the
plane and maps the closed unit disc to itself.
