# Distinct crossings at a noncrossing incident pair

In XII (4.5), page 253, every source vertex has two incident
edges which do not cross each other. Each of those edges has
its own crossing. The crossing points are distinct, since a
common one would be in the two edges' intersection, which is
only their original vertex. In particular the source has at
least two crossings.
