# A star has no circuits

The topological feasibility discs in XII (3.1), page 245, can carry
stars connecting their prescribed boundary vertices. Each edge joins
the centre to a leaf, and a leaf has only one incident edge. A closed
simple walk would either repeat that edge immediately or revisit the
centre. This proves the forest part of the construction.

/-- A loopless graph whose edges join one centre to leaves, each with
at most one incident edge, is a forest. This is the combinatorial
part of the star construction in XII (3.1), page 245. -/
