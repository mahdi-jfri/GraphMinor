# A homeomorphic small copy of the surface

The geometric construction of XII (4.5) can be performed on
a small copy of the surface and carried back by a homeomorphism.
The finite chart cover proves that the surface is small. Put
the induced topology on its small model and transfer compactness,
Hausdorffness, and the interior charts through the equivalence.
This preserves the surface hypotheses without a universe bound
in the final result.
