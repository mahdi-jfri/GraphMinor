# An intermediate region between two distant regions

For the two-disc sphere case of XII (3.2), page 247, follow the
regions from the first prescribed region to the second. XI (5.1)
supplies the step leaving the regions at distance less than the
chosen threshold. The two regions at this step share an edge and
therefore an end vertex. Their distance is at most two. The region
after this step has distance between the threshold and threshold
plus one, and the triangle inequality separates it from the other
prescribed region as well.
