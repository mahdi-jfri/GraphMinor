# Region curves which avoid the disc boundary internally

For the VI chain reduction in XII (3.2), pages 247--248, begin
with the region curve provided by VI's region-access construction.
Use closed-unit-disc coordinates and push the curve radially inward
by a continuous amount controlled by the distance to the complement
of the region. The amount vanishes at both endpoints. Thus the ends
stay fixed, while every other point stays in the region and avoids
the surface boundary.

/-- A region of a proper disc drawing has curves between its closure
points whose internal points avoid the disc boundary. This is used
to turn VI chains into the normal chords in XII (3.2). -/
