# Existence of traces for every normal finite-length curve

For XII's trace definition on page 243, order the hits in one closed
real period starting at a hit. Their number is the curve length plus
one, so the construction over consecutive intervals has twice the
curve length as its number of edges. Periodicity closes the walk.
Zero-length curves use their region's radial hub.

/-- Every normal finite-length curve has a trace in the radial drawing.
This proves trace existence in XII, page 243, including the
exact length and real-parameter conditions in `IsTrace`. -/
