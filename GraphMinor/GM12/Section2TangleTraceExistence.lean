# Traces below a tangle order

In XII (2.1) and the proof of (3.2), pages 243--246, the normal
curve length is below the tangle order. A zero-length curve has its
one-vertex trace without an edge assumption. At positive length,
the tangle order is at least two and X (2.3) supplies a drawing edge,
so the full trace construction applies.
