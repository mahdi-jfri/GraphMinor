# Reading an abstract subgraph as a subdrawing

VI (3.6), applied in XII (3.2), page 247, gives an abstract forest
subgraph. Retain its vertices and edges in the drawing. Every end
of a retained edge is already a retained vertex, so this span adds
no vertices. Its graph links are exactly those of the abstract
subgraph. This permits the return from VI's objects to XII's
connected subdrawings.
