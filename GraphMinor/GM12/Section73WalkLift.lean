# Lifting walks of the cleaned contraction

In XII (7.3), page 261, replace every spoke at the merged hub by its
two-edge old path, and use one old edge for every other spoke. All
new radial vertices are old vertices. The resulting closed walk has
length larger by twice the number of visits to the merged hub.

/-- The lifted closed walk in Graph Minors XII, (7.3), page 261,
exists and has length exactly twice the number of hub occurrences
more than the new walk. The replacement paths are constructed from
the old radial drawing, with no assumed walk-lifting step. -/
