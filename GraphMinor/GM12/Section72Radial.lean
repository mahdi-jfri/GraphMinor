# The radial drawing after the one-vertex disc deletion

This proves the radial construction in XII (7.2), page 260. Keep the
closed outside of the two-spoke circuit and delete one boundary
spoke. The reduced drawing is two-cell, and the radial conditions
are proved in the preceding lemmas. For maximality, every possible
extra spoke has an old parallel spoke in an unchanged region, or a
retained parallel spoke obtained by diversion in the merged region.

circuit gives a radial drawing of the reduced drawing. -/
