# Choosing the metric of a respectful drawing tangle

The hypothesis in XII (4.3), page 249, names a respectful tangle,
whose metric is used throughout the proof. Choose a radial drawing
and its derived inside function. The associated distance supplies
the metric data used by the free-edge selection argument.
