# Cutting the bridge of the first two-loop shape

For the Section 8 argument used by XII (3.1), page 245, cut the joining
line at its midpoint. The first circle together with the first half
and the second circle together with the second half are closed sets
meeting only at that midpoint. The attachment points lie on opposite
sides. A circle containing the bridge would therefore become disconnected
when its midpoint is removed.

/-- Cutting the joining line of two disjoint circles gives a closed

the two attachment points. -/
