# Solid unions and lines

The schismatic shapes in the Section 8 argument used by XII (3.1),
page 245, are finite unions of circles and lines. A line is solid by
its interval chart. In a compact Hausdorff space a union of two solid
sets is solid: the map from their disjoint sum onto the union is a
compact quotient, so local path-connectedness passes to the union.
The subspace criterion converts this back to the paper's local
arc-connectedness condition.
