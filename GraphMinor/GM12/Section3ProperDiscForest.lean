# Proper forests in boundary-contact discs

For XII (3.1), page 245, each feasibility disc lies in Sigma-star and
meets its surface boundary only at prescribed contacts. The constructed
star is therefore proper, and its boundary vertex set is exactly the
prescribed set. Its interior centre is not a surface boundary point.

/-- A disc whose contacts with the surface boundary form a finite set
carries a connected proper forest with exactly those boundary vertices.
This is the local forest required for XII (3.1), page 245. -/
