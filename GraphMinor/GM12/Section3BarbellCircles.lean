# Circles inside the first two-loop shape

In the Section 8 argument used by XII (3.1), page 245, the joining
edge of the first two-loop shape is a bridge. The finite-graph edge-or
lemma says that a circle either contains that edge or misses its open
part. Containing it contradicts connectedness after deleting the
midpoint. A circle missing its open part lies in the disjoint union
of the two original circles and hence in one of them.

/-- Every circle in the first two-loop shape is contained in one of
its two original circles. The joining line cannot belong to a circle. -/
