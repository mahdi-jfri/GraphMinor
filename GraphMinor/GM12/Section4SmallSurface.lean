# Reducing the universe of a closed surface

The disc constructions used for XII (4.5) may be applied on a
small copy of the surface. A compact surface has a finite cover
by charts, and each chart is homeomorphic to the open unit disc.
Thus a finite disjoint union of small chart domains maps onto
the whole surface. This proves that the surface has a small
copy, without adding a size hypothesis to the theorem.

/-- A closed surface has a copy in the lowest type universe:
compactness gives finitely many small chart domains covering
it. This permits the finite disc constructions for XII (4.5)
to be transported across universes. -/
