# Joining representatives through a finite closed cover

The normal-connection construction in the existence argument for the
minimum used by XII (3.1), page 245, uses closures of drawing regions.
A finite closed cover of a connected space has connected intersection
data: splitting its members into reachable and unreachable classes
would give two disjoint closed sets covering the space. If meeting
cover members have their representatives joined in a prescribed set,
all representatives are joined in that set.
