# A slit disc around the end of a leaf edge

The leaf step in XII (7.4), pages 262--263, extends the last
part of the leaf edge by an access arc into its incident region.
A lens around the combined line puts the leaf endpoint inside
and the other end on its boundary. The closed set `Z` consists
of the drawing that remains and the earlier part of the leaf
edge. The lens misses `Z` except at its boundary end. Hence it
lies in the new region and meets the old drawing in exactly the
last part of the leaf edge, a slit with only one boundary point.

/-- A lens around a leaf segment continued by an access arc is
a closed slit disc in the new region. The sets `L`, `B`, and `Z`
are the leaf segment, its access continuation, and the closed
remainder of the old drawing. -/
