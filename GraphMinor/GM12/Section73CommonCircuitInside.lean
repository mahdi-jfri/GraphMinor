# The inside of a circuit shared by the two radial drawings

For XII (7.3), Claim (1), page 262, a circuit retained in both
radial drawings has the same selected inside. Its old separation
has order at most half the circuit length. Adding the deleted
vertex to both sides keeps the order small, so the same disc is
selected in the deleted tangle. Two selected discs with the same
boundary agree, since otherwise they cover the surface.
