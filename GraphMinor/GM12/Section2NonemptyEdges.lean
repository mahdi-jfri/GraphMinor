# Positive-length curves below a tangle order need a drawing edge

The geometric trace lemmas use an edge of the original drawing.
In XII (2.1), a positive curve length below the tangle order makes
that order at least two. X (2.3) then excludes an edgeless graph:
three copies of any small side would already cover its edge set.
This separates the geometric argument from the zero-length case.
