# Matching a transported crossing quadruple

For XII (4.5), claim (1), page 253, an ambient disc match may
keep or reverse the boundary direction. After either case,
a boundary twist preserving direction can send its four
crossing marks to the prescribed four marks, allowing the
second and fourth marks to exchange places. Both choices
preserve the two opposite pairs. Use the increasing or
decreasing lift of the inverse circle map to distinguish
the cases, then apply the ordered four-point adjustment.
