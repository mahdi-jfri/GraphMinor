# Removing finitely many homotopically redundant chords

For the extraction used by XII (3.1), page 245, complete gaps of an
injective path have disjoint interiors. If each chord is homotopic to
a path in the first circle, remove the chords one at a time. The
one-chord pasting lemma preserves the homotopy of any path in the
carrier. After the finite induction, the resulting path stays in
the first circle.
