# Uniqueness of a disc enclosing at most one deletion

Claim (2) in XII (3.2), page 246, compares two discs with the same
boundary in Sigma-star. On a surface other than a sphere, disc
uniqueness applies directly. With at least three deleted discs, the
two proposed discs cannot cover the surface: each deletion would be
on one side, but each side contains at most one deletion. This proves
the topological comparison needed for the tangle-selected disc.

/-- If two discs cover the surface and the first boundary lies in
Sigma-star, every deleted disc is wholly in one of them. Its connected
interior avoids that boundary, and closedness restores its boundary. -/
