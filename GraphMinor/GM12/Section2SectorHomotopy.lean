# Replacing paths in a corner near its vertex

The entry-edge construction on XII page 243 needs to replace an approach
by a path in the same corner. A small patch of a sector disc is simply
connected even when the approach touches its boundary vertex tangentially.
Lift paths to that patch and map the resulting homotopy into the corner
with its vertex added.
