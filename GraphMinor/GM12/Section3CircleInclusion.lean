# A circle contains no proper circle

For the circle case of the schismatic definition used by XII (3.1),
page 245, a circle has no proper subset which is a circle. A continuous
injection of the standard circle into itself is onto: if it omitted
a point, rotate that point to minus one and use the continuous argument
as an injective real coordinate. The proved no-embedding theorem for
the circle and the line excludes that coordinate.
