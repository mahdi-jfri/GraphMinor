# Diverting a circle that misses the boundary vertex

In the rerouting step of XII (7.2), page 260, first consider a circle
that misses the one vertex on the removed disc boundary. A short arc
of that boundary around the vertex misses the circle. Pushing across
the rest of the disc, while fixing the outside drawing and the two
ends of the short arc, moves the circle completely off the disc.
