# Finite graph carriers are solid

The Section 8 reduction of VII used in XII (3.1), page 245, applies
the planar criterion to its finite graph shapes. Parametrize each
edge by a closed interval and include the finitely many vertices.
The resulting map from a finite disjoint union is a compact quotient.
Local path-connectedness passes to the quotient, giving the paper's
local arc-connectedness. The finite graph carrier is also closed.
