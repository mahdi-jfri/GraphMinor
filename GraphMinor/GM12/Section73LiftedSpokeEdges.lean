# Edges forced into a two-edge spoke lift

For XII (7.3), Claim (1), page 262, a surviving old spoke must
occur in any walk whose collapsed image contains its new edge.
Its interior misses the collapsed star, so each interior point
has a unique preimage. A two-edge lift from the deleted vertex
then also uses the unique star spoke to the old region hub.

/-- A surviving old edge occurs in a lifted walk if its image is
contained in the walk's image. Its interior has singleton fibres
under the star collapse. This supplies the surviving spoke in
