# Feasible endpoint classes from a crossing half-edge system

For XII (4.5), claim (1), page 253, clip the source half-edges
outside the crossing discs and thicken each vertex star. The
contacts of each resulting vertex disc are exactly the ends
assigned to that vertex. Ends of different residual half-edges
are distinct, since the residual arcs are disjoint. This gives
the source endpoint partition together with its disc witnesses.

/-- A half-edge system meeting only at its source vertices or
inside the crossing-disc set yields disjoint vertex discs whose
contacts are exactly the assigned, distinct half-edge ends.
This combines the source clipping and thickening steps of
XII (4.5), claim (1), page 253. -/
