# Solid sets under closed embeddings

The Section 8 argument of VII used in XII (3.1), page 245, applies
the planar criterion inside a capped surface. A closed embedding
preserves a solid set: closedness passes through the closed map, and
open neighbourhoods pull back to the original space. Arc connections
map to arc connections by the embedding.
