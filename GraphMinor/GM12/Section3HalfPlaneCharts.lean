# Reading complex half-plane charts as surface charts

For the punctured surface of XII (3.1), page 245, the remaining local
charts are charts at the prescribed disc boundaries. Circle coordinates
are naturally written in the complex plane. A chart onto the intersection
of an open complex set with the right half-plane gives the half-space
chart required by the definition of a surface.
