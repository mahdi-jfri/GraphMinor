# Gluing the removed disc to an outside bigon

For maximality in XII (7.2), page 260, a disc between the deleted
spoke and a new spoke can be joined to the removed disc. Their
intersection is just that spoke. The joined disc is bounded by the
retained spoke and the new spoke. The side lemmas here also locate
the intersection of two discs whose open interiors are disjoint.
