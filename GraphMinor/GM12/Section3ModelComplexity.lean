# The complexity condition for applying VII

The surface theorem used in XII (3.1), page 245, requires complexity
at least three. The excluded cases are a sphere with at most two holes.
We identify the model with no handles, cross-caps or holes directly
from its quotient definition. The hypothesis of XII (3.1) then gives
the required complexity bound.
