# The unique edge at a leaf

For the omitted entry-edge lemma on XII page 243, a vertex with one
half-edge has one incident non-loop edge. Every other edge closure
misses the vertex. A loop would supply two distinct half-edges there.
The incident edge closure is therefore a line with the leaf as one end.
