# A cross-cut of an open disc

Let `p` be an open disc in a closed surface, and let `a` be a line or an `O`-arc with its ends off `p`
and all of its other points in `p`. Collapse the complement of `p` to a point. This gives a sphere, and `a`
becomes an `O`-arc. So the Jordan curve theorem cuts `p` along `a` into exactly two parts, and the
whole line is on the frontier of each. Each part is an open disc, by `isOpenDisc_of_bound`
(`exists_crosscut_sides`).
