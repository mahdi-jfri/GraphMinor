# Choosing circle ports off finitely many lines

For the crossing drawing in XII (4.5), page 253, a new circle port
must avoid the lines through old ports and old crossing points.
A line through a point of a sphere meets that sphere in at most two
points. Every open circle arc of length less than a turn is infinite,
so finitely many such lines cannot cover it.
