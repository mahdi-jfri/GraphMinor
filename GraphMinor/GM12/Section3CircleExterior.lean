# Surface charts on the outside of a circle

For the boundary charts in XII (3.1), page 245, circle coordinates
identify a neighbourhood outside a deleted disc with the outside of
the unit circle. The semicircle coordinate change sends that set to
a half-plane. Rotation gives the same chart at every unit-circle point.
