# Graph Minors XII, (7.4)

A respectful tangle survives deletion of a vertex in a two-cell
component, with the four distance and point-set bounds on pages
262--263. We follow the paper's induction on the number of edges.
If a selected normal one-vertex disc contains an edge, apply
(7.2), use the induction hypothesis outside the disc, and transfer
all four conclusions back. Otherwise distinct corner regions,
finite edge gluing, and final leaf deletion show that deleting
the vertex is two-cell. Apply (7.3), with the local bounds for
the removed atoms, in that base case.

/-- Graph Minors XII, (7.4), pages 262--263. Vertex deletion has
a two-cell component with a respectful tangle of order one less,
shared-atom distances decreasing by at most two, and distance
to its region of the deleted vertex decreasing by at most one.
All original atoms contained in that region have old distance
at most two from the deleted vertex. The component condition
uses the connected components of the drawing's point set. -/
