# A simple arc does not separate a closed surface

The target-region disc preparation in XII (4.5), page 253,
uses that a proper closed subset of a circle cannot separate
the surface. First prove the corresponding fact for an arc.
Put a one-edge drawing on the arc. It contains no circuit,
since a simple closed curve cannot lie in a line. The forest
complement lemma then proves its complement is connected.
