# Feasibility discs in the punctured surface

In XII (3.1), page 245, each topological feasibility disc meets the
deleted discs only at its prescribed boundary vertices. Consequently
it lies in Sigma-star. A closed disc in a surface can meet the surface
boundary only on its own boundary. Thus the prescribed vertices lie
on the feasibility disc boundary, where a finite star can be drawn.
