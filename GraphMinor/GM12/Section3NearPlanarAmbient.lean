# Near-planar sets are planar after all deleted discs are filled

In the candidate-existence step used by XII (3.1), page 245, a
near-planar set in the punctured surface becomes planar in the
original closed surface. If it is already planar, include its
containing disc. Otherwise fill its one cuff first, use the containing
disc in that partial fill, and include that disc in the closed surface.
Both inclusions preserve the points of the original set.
