# Boundary vertices among the terms of a disc chain

In the VI (3.6) chain reduction used by XII (3.2), pages 247--248,
only the first and last terms can be peripheral. Thus any vertex
term on the surface boundary is one of the two chain endpoints.
This ensures that the normal carrier built from internal region
curves meets the surface boundary only at those endpoints.
