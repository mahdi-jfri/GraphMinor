# Simply connected convex chart patches

The local rerouting in the circle-intersection step used by XII (3.1),
page 245, must preserve the homotopy in the surface. A convex part of
a chart is simply connected after mapping back. Lift each loop with
the chart inverse and contract it by straight segments to one point.
This works for half-plane charts as well as interior charts.

/-- A convex patch mapped by a chart with continuous inverse is
simply connected. The stated inverse condition is needed only on the
chosen convex patch. -/
