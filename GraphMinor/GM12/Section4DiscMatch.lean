# Matching nested discs and adjusting boundary points

XII (4.3), claim (7), page 251, uses a homeomorphism carrying the
source edge neighborhoods to their prescribed discs. For three
nested discs, join the two collars into one coordinate map and
change the radius to carry the inner disc onto the middle disc.
The resulting homeomorphism fixes the exterior of the outer disc.
A second construction extends an orientation preserving circle map
across a collar, preserving the middle disc and fixing the exterior.
