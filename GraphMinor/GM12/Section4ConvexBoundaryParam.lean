# A convex subdisc parametrization fixing its circle contacts

For the target discs of XII (4.5), page 253, shrinking a disc
must preserve the cyclic order of the four boundary marks.
A convex set containing a neighborhood of zero is radially
homeomorphic to the unit disc. If it is contained in the unit
disc, every common unit-circle point is on both frontiers and
has gauge one for both sets. The radial homeomorphism fixes
those points, giving a boundary parametrization that retains
their original circle parameters.

/-- A closed bounded convex subset of the unit disc containing
a neighborhood of zero has a boundary parametrization fixing
all of its unit-circle contacts. This preserves the order of
the target marks when shrinking region discs in XII (4.5),
