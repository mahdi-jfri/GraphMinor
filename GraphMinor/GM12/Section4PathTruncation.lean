# Removing the last vertex of a path

XII (4.4), page 252, deletes the last vertex of each external path
and retains its incident edge as a joining edge. Reverse a simple
walk tracing the path. Its first edge is the retained joining edge,
and the remaining walk traces the shortened path. Simplicity
excludes the removed vertex and joining edge from that remainder.

/-- The path truncation used in XII (4.4), page 252. The shortened
path has exactly the old vertices except the terminal vertex, and
exactly the old edges except its incident terminal edge. -/
