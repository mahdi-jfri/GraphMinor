# Replacing a chord inside an arbitrary path

The finite-chord reduction used by XII (3.1), page 245, replaces one
chord at a time. A fixed-end homotopy of the chord to a path in the
remaining closed set extends to paths in their union: use the chord
homotopy on the chord and keep the remaining set fixed. These maps
agree at the attachment endpoints. Pasting over two closed sets proves
continuity, including paths which traverse the chord many times.

/-- Replace a chord in any path through its union with a closed set.
The new path lies in the image of the closed set and is homotopic to
the image of the original path, with both ends fixed. -/
