# Radius coordinates for joining two collars

For the disc homeomorphism used in XII (4.3), claim (7), page 251,
join an inner collar of radius two to an outer collar. On the outer
annulus the change of radius is `r ↦ r - 1`. Using a denominator
bounded below by two gives a continuous plane map, including at zero.
