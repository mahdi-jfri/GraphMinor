# Graph Minors XII, (7.3)

Deleting a vertex while preserving a two-cell drawing loses at
most two in shared-atom distances, and at most one in distance
to the deleted vertex's region. We follow the radial contraction
and lifted-walk proof on pages 261--262, using the visit bounds
from the proved construction of XI (9.2). First remove selected
one-vertex discs containing edges. This finite reduction corrects
the paper's parallel-spoke assertion and preserves all needed
old lower bounds. The reduced radial construction then proves
both inequalities. Original order two uses the order-one case.

/-- Graph Minors XII, (7.3), pages 261--262. A two-cell vertex
deletion has a respectful tangle of order one less, with shared
atom distances decreasing by at most two and distance to the
merged region decreasing by at most one. The finite selected-disc
reduction corrects the paper's assertion that the old
radial drawing has no parallel spokes at the vertex, which fails
when there is a contractible loop at the vertex. See the correction
to the proof of (7.3) in `corrections/GM12.md`. -/
