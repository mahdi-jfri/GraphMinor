# The step of (6.6) at order 2 in Case 2 of XII (7.5)

At `θ = 3`, Case 2 of (7.5) passes from the tangle `T₂` of order 2 in `Γ₂ = Γ₁ \ v` to a tangle of order 2
in `Γ₃`, by (6.6). But (6.6) fails at order 2 for a drawing with loops, and `Γ₃` may have loops. We use
that `T₂` comes from a tangle `T₁` of order 3 in `Γ₁`.

Let `T₃` be the pretangle in `Γ₃` induced by the slope of `T₂`. By X (2.7) we need that a loop `e` of `Γ₃`
has a small side. Suppose not. Then `Γ₃ \ e` is small. Let `s` be the region of `J` containing `e`, and
`g` the edge of `Γ₂` in `s`. Every other region of `J` lies in the disc of a short circuit in `N(Z)`, and
`N(Z)` lies in `s̄`, so the vertex of `Γ₂` on that circuit is an end of `g`. By (6.3) these discs give
two members of `T₂`, one for each end of `g`, whose left sides and `g` make up `Γ₂`. This contradicts
`false_of_cover_of_edge`.
