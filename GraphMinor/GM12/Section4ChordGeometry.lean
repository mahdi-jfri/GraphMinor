# Chord arcs and their intersections

In the crossing construction of XII (4.5), page 253, a straight
chord is a simple arc. Strict convexity puts its interior inside
the open unit disc. Distinct supporting lines give finite pairwise
intersections, and the choice of supporting lines rules out triple
intersections of the arcs as well.
