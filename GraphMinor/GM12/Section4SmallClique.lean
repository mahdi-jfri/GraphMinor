# Drawing the small clique targets

The small cases in XII (4.4), page 251, follow from (4.3) because
the target clique can be drawn in the surface. For at most two
vertices, use an edgeless drawing or one line inside a surface
chart. The branch construction of (4.4) also works for three and
four vertices, since each vertex then has two other vertices.
