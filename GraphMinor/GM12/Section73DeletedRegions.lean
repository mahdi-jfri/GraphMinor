# Regions meeting a deleted vertex

In XII (7.3), page 261, the radial hubs that merge into the new
region are the hubs of old regions incident with the deleted vertex.
If an old region meets the new region containing the vertex, a
connected set crosses its frontier. A frontier point missing from
the deleted drawing is either the deleted vertex or belongs to a
deleted incident edge. In both cases the vertex lies in the closure
of the old region.
