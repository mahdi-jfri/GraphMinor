# Retaining finitely many complete chords

For the circle extraction used by XII (3.1), page 245, the local
reroutings retain finitely many outer pieces of an injective path.
Extend each such piece to the complete gap at its partition endpoint.
Both ends of the original path lie on the solid set, so every gap has
two contact endpoints. The homotopic path therefore lies in the solid
set together with finitely many complete chords, whose interiors miss
that set.

/-- An injective path with both ends on a solid set is homotopic to a
path in that set together with finitely many complete original chords.
Degenerate chords are allowed and consist of contact points. -/
