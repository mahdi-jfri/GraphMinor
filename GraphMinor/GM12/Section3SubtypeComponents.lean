# Edges when a drawing is read in a smaller ambient space

In XII (3.1), page 245, the drawing is read in the surface left after
removing the prescribed discs. Its support remains in that surface.
Path components of a subset do not change when the ambient space is
restricted to a set containing it. This file proves that fact for the
arc-component definition used by drawings.
