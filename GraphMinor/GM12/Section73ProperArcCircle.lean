# Compactifying a proper arc in a disc face

For the maximality verification in XII (7.3), page 261, an added
spoke lies in an old disc face except at its ends. Collapse the
complement of that face to infinity. The spoke becomes a circle in
the one-point compactification, which is a sphere. The Jordan curve
theorem can then separate the two sides of the added spoke.
