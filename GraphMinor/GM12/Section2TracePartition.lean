# Assembling a trace over its ordered vertex parameters

The trace in XII, page 243, concatenates one two-edge walk for each
region interval between consecutive vertex parameters. This file proves
that finite assembly, including the length count. It separates the
ordering of the parameters from the geometric construction of each
individual step.

list. Each interval contributes exactly two edges, so the full walk
has twice the number of intervals as its length. -/
