# Simply connected patches at manifold points

The homotopy-preserving circle rerouting used in the Section 8 argument
for XII (3.1), page 245, needs small simply connected patches. Restrict
a half-plane chart to a ball about the chosen point. The intersection
of the ball and half-plane is convex. Mapping it back gives an open
simply connected neighbourhood, including at boundary points.
