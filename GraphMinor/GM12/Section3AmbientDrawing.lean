# Returning a drawing from a closed subspace to the surface

After VII is applied in the punctured surface of XII (3.1), page 245,
its subdrawings must be read in the original surface. The punctured
surface is closed, so inclusion preserves closed supports and edge
closures. Arc-components and their line or circle parametrizations
then give the ambient drawing with the same vertices and edges.
