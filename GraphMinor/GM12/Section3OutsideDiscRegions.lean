# The outside of a disc as a union of regions

For the one-cuff candidate-existence argument used by XII (3.1),
page 245, add the disc boundary to the drawing. Each region meeting
the outside of the disc stays outside, since a connected region
cannot cross the boundary. Drawing carriers have empty interior, so
the outside regions are dense in the outside of the disc. Their
union therefore has the required disc complement as its closure.
