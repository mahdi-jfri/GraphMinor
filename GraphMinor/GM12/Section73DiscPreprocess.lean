# Removing a selected one-vertex disc before vertex contraction

The parallel-edge claim in the proof of XII (7.3), page 261, fails
when a loop is attached at the deleted vertex: the outer loop face
has two corners there even though deleting the vertex leaves a two-cell drawing.
The smallest correction first applies (7.2) to such selected insides.
Here we prove that this does not change the drawing after vertex
deletion. Its connected point set misses the one-vertex boundary.
The third tangle axiom provides a surviving vertex outside the disc,
so the whole deleted drawing lies outside it.
