# Chord crossings across the end of a full turn

The source drawing for XII (4.5), page 253, uses cyclic vertex
blocks. An end outside the interval of a chord can lie before its
first end or after its last end in the chosen full turn. Adding
one turn in the first case gives the usual alternating order.

/-- A chord from an inside port to an outside port crosses the
chord bounding the interval. This includes a port before the start
of the chosen turn, as needed in XII (4.5), page 253. -/
