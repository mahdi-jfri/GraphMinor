# Definitions for Graph Minors I, Section 2 (Grids)

This file gives the definitions used in Section 2 of
N. Robertson and P. D. Seymour, *Graph Minors. I. Excluding a forest*,
J. Combin. Theory Ser. B **35** (1983), 39–61 (pages 41–50).

## Representation

A finite graph in Section 2 is represented as a subgraph `G : (⊤ : SimpleGraph α).Subgraph` with
`G.verts.Finite`. All results (2.1)–(2.9) of Section 2 concern grid minors, paths, connected
subgraphs, connected components, and vertex separators, which depend only on the underlying simple
graph; representing subgraphs of `G` (paths, stars, and the `Bⱼ`) as `H ≤ G` retains their edge sets
so that the proofs can delete and contract edges as in the paper.

* `toGraph G`: the Mathlib multigraph `Graph α (Sym2 α)` with vertex set `G.verts` and edge set
  `G.edgeSet`.
* `gridGraph θ`: the `θ`-grid `Graph.ofSimpleGraph (pathGraph θ □ pathGraph θ)`, whose vertex
  `(i, j)` corresponds to the paper's `v_{i+1, j+1}`.
* `𝓕 θ` (with notation `𝓕_θ`): the set of graphs `G` with no minor isomorphic to `gridGraph θ`.
* `Path α`: a path in `α`, given by its initial vertex `first`, its terminal vertex `last`, and a
  walk `walk : (⊤ : SimpleGraph α).Walk first last` with `walk.IsPath`. Its subgraph is
  `P.toSubgraph`, its vertex set is `P.verts`, its ends are `P.ends = {P.first, P.last}`, and its
  internal vertices are `P.internalVerts = P.verts \ P.ends`.
* `Path.Precedes`, `Path.MeetsInOrder`, `Path.IsFirstGe`: the order of vertices along a path.
* `Path.IsIn`, `Path.IsFromTo`, `Path.Avoids`, `Separates`: paths in `G`, paths from `A₁` to `A₂`,
  paths avoiding `X`, and vertex sets `X` separating `Y` and `Z` in `G`.
* `IsDisjointPathFamily`, `IsUniqueDisjointPathFamily`: families of disjoint paths from `A₁` to
  `A₂`, and uniqueness of such a set of paths as in (2.5) and (2.6).
* `IsStarWithCenter`, `IsStar`, `IsTreeSubgraph`, `IsLeafOf`, `numComponents`: stars, trees,
  end-vertices, and the number of connected components of a subgraph.
