# Statements that Graph Minors XI cites

Graph Minors XI quotes these results from outside the paper. Each is a `Prop` about the actual
definitions, and the theorems of the paper take them as hypotheses.

- `GM07Theorem112Statement`, `GM07Theorem1110Statement`: Graph Minors VII, (11.2) and (11.10).

Two classical facts on the plane, which the paper uses silently when it says that a drawing without
circuits has only one region, are proved in `GraphMinor/GM11/PlaneFacts.lean`.

Graph Minors X, (2.7), which the paper also cites, is `GM10.theorem_2_7`, already proved. Epstein's
theorem, which is (7.1) and (7.2) of the paper, is `Surface.EpsteinStatement`, and the other
topological facts are the `Prop`s of `GraphMinor/Surface/TopologyStatements.lean`.
