# Graph Minors XI, (6.3)

The paper states without proof (Section 3, page 75): "every region of $\Gamma'$ includes a unique edge of
$\Gamma$", "unless $|V(\Gamma)| = 1$ and $E(\Gamma) = \emptyset$", and adds: "We omit the proofs of these assertions, which
are elementary but rather tedious." The same sentence is used for the vertices on the closure of a
region (proof of (6.5), page 91).

This is `regionFacts_of_radial` for a drawing and `regionFacts_of_painting` for a painting. With them,
`theorem_6_3` proves `GM14.GM11Theorem63Statement` with no hypothesis, by the paper's proof.
