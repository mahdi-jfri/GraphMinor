# Drawings on a line and on an `O`-arc

A line with finitely many marked points that include its ends, and an `O`-arc with a non-empty finite
set of marked points, each carry a drawing whose vertices are the marked points
(`exists_drawing_on_line`, `exists_drawing_on_oArc`). They are used to turn a painting into a drawing.
