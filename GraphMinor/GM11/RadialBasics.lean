# Tools for radial drawings

Graph Minors XI omits the proof that "every region of $\Gamma'$ includes a unique edge of $\Gamma$", for a radial
drawing `Γ'` of `Γ` (Section 3, page 75). This file has three general tools for that proof.

* `Drawing.glue`: the union of two drawings that meet only in common vertices, with its edges.
* `isOArc_union`: two lines with the same ends and nothing else in common form an `O`-arc.
* `exists_disc_in_openDisc`: an `O`-arc in an open disc bounds a closed disc in that open disc.
