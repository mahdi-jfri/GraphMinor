# Two facts on the plane, and closed surfaces are surfaces

Graph Minors XI says that a drawing without circuits in a connected surface has only one region.
Our proof of that fact, in `GraphMinor/GM11/ForestRegions.lean`, uses two classical facts on the
plane: an arc does not separate the plane, and Janiszewski's theorem. Both are proved over `ℂ` in
`GraphMinor/Surface/PlaneSeparation.lean` and `GraphMinor/Surface/Crossing.lean`. This file carries
them over the isometry `complexPlane` to `EuclideanPlane`, as `isPreconnected_compl_of_isLine` and
`janiszewski_plane`.

It also proves `IsClosedSurface.isSurface`: a compact 2-manifold without boundary is a compact
2-manifold with (possibly null) boundary. An open disc embeds as an open subset of the half plane by
a translation.
