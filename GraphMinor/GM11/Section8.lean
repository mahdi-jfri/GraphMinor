# Graph Minors XI, Section 8: the regions in `ins(W)`

`theorem_8_2` is statement (8.2): three closed walks of length `< 2θ` do not cover `Σ` by their sets
`ins(W)`. The proof is the paper's. The set `Z` of regions in `ins(W)` is small with respect to the
weighting `(V(Γ), 2θ)`, and (5.5) applies. The paper derives "small" from (4.5). We use (5.2) and (4.4)
instead: if the complement of `Z` were small, then the region outside `ins(W)` would be captured.
