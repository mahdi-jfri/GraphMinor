# Drawings without circuits: graph theory

Graph Minors XI uses in the proof of (4.4) that a drawing without circuits has only one region. This
file has the combinatorial part: a drawing with an edge and no circuit has a leaf (`exists_leaf`),
found at the end of a longest path. It also has `isPreconnected_sdiff_of_local`, the connectedness
principle used to remove a piece of a drawing from a connected open set, and the basic facts on
`deleteEdge`.
