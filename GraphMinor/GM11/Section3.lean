# Section 3 of Graph Minors XI: homotopy, and the corrected form of (3.1)

Statement (3.1) of the paper is false as it stands (see the correction to (3.1) in
`corrections/GM11.md`). This file proves `theorem_3_1`, which adds one local hypothesis,
`IsLocalDeformationRetract`.

The proof follows the paper. It looks at the times when `φ` leaves `Y`, and on those intervals it
replaces `φ` by a path in `X ∩ Y`, using that `X` is simply-connected. The paper does this for all
of the infinitely many intervals at once, and that is the gap. We cut the circle into finitely many
pieces instead. On a piece that stays near one point of `X ∩ Y`, the local hypothesis pushes all
excursions of `φ` into `X ∩ Y` in one step. The remaining pieces are either in `Y` already, or are
single excursions in `X`, which are handled as in the paper.

The file also gives the tools on loops that this needs: a map from `[0, 1]` that agrees at the ends
gives a map from the circle (`loopLift`), and in a simply-connected set any two paths with the same
ends are homotopic (`IsSimplyConnectedSet.pathsHomotopic`).

/-- **Graph Minors XI, (3.1)**, corrected (page 76). If `X, Y ⊆ Σ` are closed, and `X` is
simply-connected and `X ∩ Y` is non-empty and arc-wise connected, and moreover `X` deforms locally
into `X ∩ Y` (`IsLocalDeformationRetract`), then any continuous `φ : S¹ → X ∪ Y` is homotopic in
`X ∪ Y` to a continuous `φ' : S¹ → Y`.

The paper has no local hypothesis, and without one the statement is false (see the correction to
(3.1) in `corrections/GM11.md`). The hypothesis holds in the paper's uses: there `X` is a closed
disc and `X ∩ Y` is its boundary (`IsClosedDisc.isLocalDeformationRetract`), except in (7.8) as used
in (8.8), where `X` and `Y` are unions of vertices, edges and regions of a drawing. The space need
not be a surface. -/
