# Definitions of Graph Minors XI

This file formalizes the definitions of N. Robertson and P. D. Seymour,
*Graph Minors. XI. Circuits on a surface*, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 60 (1994) 72–106. Everything
is stated over the actual drawings and paintings of `GraphMinor/Surface/Defs.lean`.

- **Section 2:** tangles are those of Graph Minors X (`GM10.IsTangle`).
- **Section 3:** the type `PaintingOrDrawing` for the paper's "painting or drawing". Subdrawings:
  `Drawing.span` builds the subdrawing with given vertices and edges, and adds the ends of the
  edges. Circuits and paths (`Drawing.IsCircuit`, `Drawing.IsPathBetween`). Radial drawings
  (`PaintingOrDrawing.IsRadialDrawing`). Walks: concatenation, reverse, `Γ | W`, curves that trace
  a walk (`WalkTraces`) and homotopy of walks (`WalkHomotopicIn`).
- **Section 4:** `Γ ∩ Δ` (`PaintingOrDrawing.inter`), respectful tangles, slopes (`IsSlope`),
  capture, confined subdrawings, `ins(Γ')` (`insOf`), non-separable drawings.
- **Section 5:** weightings, `N(Z)`, small sets.
- **Section 6:** pretangles (`IsPretangle`), the derived slope, the induced pretangle, perimeters
  of regions and even slopes.
- **Section 7:** nice sets, and the terms of Graph Minors VII, Section 11, that (7.3) and (7.5)
  quote: arc-connected, locally arc-connected, solid, flat, planar.
- **Section 8:** `Γ`-nice sets, perimeter walks, `l(X)`, restraints, extreme and optimal restraints.
- **Section 9:** atoms (in `Surface/Defs.lean`), the distance `d`, ties.

The paper's `θ ≥ 1` is half an integer. We write `k = 2θ`, a natural number with `2 ≤ k`, so that
"length `< 2θ`" reads `length < k`.
