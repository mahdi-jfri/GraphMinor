# Cutting a surface along a line

Let `L` be a line of a surface that misses the boundary. We make `L` a segment of the real axis in a chart, and remove the
open ball around it that has the segment as a diameter. The map `slitMap` of `SlitPlane.lean` folds the circle onto the
segment, and it is the identity on a larger circle. So the surface without the open disc, with this map, is the surface cut
along `L`. The surface with the disc back in is the old surface, and the inclusion is homotopic to the map onto the old
surface. `IsSlit` collects these facts, and `exists_slit` proves them.
