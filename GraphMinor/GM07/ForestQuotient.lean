# Identifying vertices of a forest

This is the combinatorial part of the proof of (4.5) of Graph Minors VII (page 223). There, `φ(H')` is shown to be a forest from a shortest cyclic sequence of paths `P'_1, ..., P'_k` in distinct components. We record this with a graph.

Let `X` be a set of vertices of a forest, let `f` identify some vertices of `X`, and let `c` name the class of a vertex under paths. The graph `classGraph f c X` has a node for each value of `f`, a node for each class, and for each `x` in `X` an edge from `f x`
to `c x`. A simple closed walk in it passes through distinct classes, which is what minimality of `k` gives in the paper. If the graph after identifying is a forest, then `classGraph` is a forest (`classGraph_forest`). Conversely, if `classGraph` is a forest
and `G` is a forest with the same classes on `X`, then the graph after identifying `G` is a forest (`quotient_forest`). Since homotopic forests have the same classes on the boundary, this gives the forest claim of (4.5).
