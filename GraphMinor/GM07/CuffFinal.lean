# Graph Minors VII, (5.9)

This is the end of the proof of (5.9), pages 233-237. It puts together the core and the collar at each cuff, with the numbers of the paper, and then uses `isGFeasible_of_collars`.

(5.9) rests on (4.6), which is `theorem_4_6`.

/-- Graph Minors VII, (5.9) (pages 233–237):
"(5.9) *Let $\Sigma \cong \Sigma(a, b, c)$, where $c \ge 2$ and $(a, b, c) \ne (0, 0, 2)$. Let
$k \ge 0$ be an integer. Let $G$ be a boundary-linked proper graph in $\Sigma$ with
$|V(G) \cap \mathrm{bd}(\Sigma)| \le 2k$ and with $\alpha(G) > 9k v(\Sigma, k)$, such that for
every cuff $C$, $|V(G) \cap C| \ge 2$. Let $H$ be a forest in $\Sigma$ with
$V(G) \cap \mathrm{bd}(\Sigma) = V(H) \cap \mathrm{bd}(\Sigma)$. Then $H$ is $G$-feasible.*"

See `IsCuffCore` for the parts of the proof at one cuff, `IsCuffCollar` for what they give, and `isGFeasible_of_collars` for the final step. -/
