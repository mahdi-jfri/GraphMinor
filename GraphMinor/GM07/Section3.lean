# Graph Minors VII, Section 3: Matchings and Forests

This file formalizes Section 3 (pages 218–221) of N. Robertson and P. D. Seymour,
*Graph Minors. VII. Disjoint paths on a surface*, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 45 (1988) 212–254:
- `(3.1)` (`theorem_3_1`): For any fixed surface `Σ` there are only finitely many similarity
  classes of proper `I`-arcs.
- `(3.2)` (`theorem_3_2_claim_1`, `theorem_3_2`): For any fixed surface `Σ` and `s, t ∈ bd(Σ)`,
  there are only finitely many parallel classes of `I`-arcs with ends `s, t`.
- `(3.3)` (`theorem_3_3`): For any surface `Σ` and finite `X ⊆ bd(Σ)`, there are only finitely many
  congruence classes of `X`-matchings.
- `(3.4)` (`theorem_3_4`): For any surface `Σ` and finite `Y ⊆ bd(Σ)`, there are only finitely many
  homoplasty classes of `Y`-forests.
- `(3.5)` (`theorem_3_5`): For every matching `G` in `Σ` and every homoplasty class `ℬ` there
  exists `H ∈ ℬ` with `U(G) ∩ U(H)` finite.
- `(3.6)` (`theorem_3_6`): Existence of the bound `w(Σ, k, n)` (`wSurface S k n`).
