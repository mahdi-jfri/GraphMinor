# The maximal path of VII (4.6), pages 228-229

This is the graph part of the argument. Take a forest with a set `B` of vertices, such that each
vertex outside `B` that has an edge has a second edge. A longest path must then have both
of its ends in `B`. A shortest path with distinct ends in `B` has no other vertex in `B`.
