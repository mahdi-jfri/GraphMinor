# The disc-side argument for the unique seam region

In VII (4.6), page 226, the complement of the seam is connected and
dense in the original surface. If a disc boundary misses that complement,
the complement lies on one side of the disc. Either the disc contains
the whole original surface, or it meets that surface only in its boundary.
This also applies when the disc lies in a capped surface.
