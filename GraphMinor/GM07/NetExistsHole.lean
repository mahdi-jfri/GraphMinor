# A polygon whose free sides are given arcs

This is the step "augment" of Graph Minors VII, page 216, for one component of the surface cut along the drawing. A connected surface
is a model surface, so it is a polygon with one free side around each cuff (`presents_ew`). The other sides are the added edges. We
move each free side along its cuff and split it, so that its parts are the arcs on this cuff (`exists_hole_word`).
