# Claim (2) of VII (4.6)

Page 229: "Since $U(J) \cap S = \emptyset$, it follows that $\phi$ maps $R_1$ and its boundary $C_1 \cup F$ homeomorphically onto
$S$, $A$, respectively." Here `R₁` is a closed disc in `Δ`, and `S` is the inside of a closed disc `Z` of `Σ` with boundary `A`. What we
know at this point is that `φ` is one to one on the inside of `R₁` (the net identifies no inner point of `Δ`), that it maps the inside of
`R₁` into the inside of `Z`, and that it maps the boundary of `R₁` into the boundary of `Z`.

We prove the claim for any continuous map `φ` with finite fibres between surfaces with these three properties
(`injOn_of_disc_to_disc`).
1. The image of the inside of `R₁` is open, by invariance of domain, and closed in the inside of `Z`, since the boundary goes to the
   boundary. The inside of `Z` is connected, so the image is all of it.
2. Two points `x ≠ y` of the boundary of `R₁` with the same image `p` are impossible. Near `p`, the inside of `Z` meets a small open set
   `W` in a connected set. Small disjoint neighbourhoods of the finitely many points over `p` split the part of the inside of `R₁` over
   `W` in two nonempty open parts, one near `x`, the other near the other points, and their images split the connected set.
