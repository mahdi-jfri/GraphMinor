# Homeomorphisms homotopic to the identity

(4.4) of Graph Minors VII (page 223) asks for a forest homotopic to a given one, not only homoplastic. So the forest may be moved only by homeomorphisms that keep curves in their homotopy classes. `IsMove α` says this for curves with ends on the boundary. A homeomorphism that lives in a convex chart is a move, by a straight line homotopy in the chart (`isMove_of_chart`), and the image of a forest under a move is homotopic to it (`forestsHomotopic_of_move`). The main example shrinks an arc off the boundary towards one of its ends (`exists_line_slide`).
