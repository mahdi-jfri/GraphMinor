# Adding lines to a flat set

This file is the first half of the proof of (4.3) of Graph Minors VII (pages 222 and 223). The paper picks a set `Y` maximal among the unions of
regions, edges and vertices all of whose `O`-arcs are null-homotopic, and says that it is "easy to see" that `Y` contains every edge at a vertex of `Y`.
Here is the reason (`IsFlat.union_line`, `IsFlat.union_edge`). A line `L` with an end in `Y` has a thin closed disc around it, the disc of
`exists_edge_lens`. Its boundary lies in `Y`, except possibly for the other end of `L`, so by (11.3) adding the inside of the disc keeps `Y` flat.
