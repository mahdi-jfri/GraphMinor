# Forests are flat

A closed curve in a forest drawn in a surface is null-homotopic (`isFlat_forest`). So two curves in the forest with the same ends are homotopic. This is used in (4.5) of Graph Minors VII (page 223), where curves of two forests are compared without following them edge by edge.

The proof peels off a leaf (`exists_forest_leaf`). If `L` is a line that meets a closed set `T` only in one end `x`, then `T ∪ L` shrinks onto `T` by pulling `L` along itself to `x`, so a closed curve in `T ∪ L` is homotopic to one in `T` (`IsFlat.union_line_end`).
