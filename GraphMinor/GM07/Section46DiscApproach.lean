# Small connected approaches in a closed disc

The lift of the open net disc in VII (4.6), page 226, is extended to
the boundary by a limit. In a closed disc each point has small open
neighbourhoods which meet the open disc in a convex set. So the part
of each such neighbourhood in the open disc is connected.
