# The lifted matching in VII (4.6)

On page 226, `θ⁻¹(K)` is a matching in `Σ′`, and `Δ` is obtained from `Σ′`
by cutting along it. Here we take three facts about `K`: each vertex
lies in the closure of exactly one edge, each edge has two ends, and `θ`
is one-to-one over `U(K)`. The pullback is then a matching. The cut map
`ψ` inherits its properties from `φ`.
