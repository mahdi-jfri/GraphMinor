# Pushing a surface off a cuff

Let `C` be a cuff of a surface and let `Z` be a closed set. In a collar of `C`, each point `(w, t)` has a height `t`. Let
`d w` be at most the distance from `(w, 0)` to `Z`, so that `Z` has no point under the height `d w`. The map that sends height
`t` to `max t ((d w + t) / 2)` leaves `Z` alone and lifts the cuff to height `d w / 2`, which is positive off `Z`. It extends by
the identity to a one to one map `ρ` of the surface, homotopic to the identity (`exists_taper`). The paper uses this in
"we may assume that `X ∩ bd(Σ') ⊆ V(G')`" in its proofs of (7.1) and (7.2), and for pushing a loop off itself in (7.3).
