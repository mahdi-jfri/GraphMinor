# The dense connected complement of a seam

For the disc-side argument on page 226 of VII (4.6), the unique seam
region is connected and dense in the surface. Connectedness comes from
the open disc before pasting. Density follows by mapping the dense
interior of that closed disc under the associated surjection.
