# The `w` bound after cutting

VII (4.6), page 226, uses the fact that `w(Σ′,2k,3(2a+b+c-1))`
depends only on the homeomorphism type of `Σ′`. Transport matchings,
forests and their homoplasties along a homeomorphism to transport every
valid bound. The upper cuff bound then places its model among the
finitely many models in the maximum defining `w`.
