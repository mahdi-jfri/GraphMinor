# Growing a disc around a part of a drawing

The tools here fill in two sentences of Graph Minors VII: "by Menger's theorem" in the use of Graph Minors III, (4.1) for (5.8), and "because `G` is
boundary-linked" on page 238. Each says that a part of a drawing, cut off from the rest by a set `X` of vertices, is cut off by a normal `O`-arc through `X`.
We grow a closed disc around the part.

First, `exists_disc_push_off`: a closed disc grows a little past its boundary, keeping away from a closed set.

/-- **Absorbing lines into a disc.** On a sphere, let `B` be a closed disc and let `ℓ` be finitely many lines, which run outside `B` from its boundary to its boundary
or to points of `X`. They meet each other and `Y` only in `X`. Then a larger disc holds `B`, it misses the connected set `Y₀`, and its boundary meets `Y` and the
lines only in `X`. We take the lines one at a time. A line with both ends on `B` is added with the side of it away from `Y₀`, and any other line is added with a
thin disc around it. Then `exists_disc_push_off` takes the boundary off the line. -/
