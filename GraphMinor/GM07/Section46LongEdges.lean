# Long and short seam edges in VII (4.6)

On page 225 an edge is long when its closure meets at least `2μ + w + 2`
vertices of `G`. All other seam edges are short. The boundary vertex bound
excludes long edges on cuffs. Short edges have at most `w + 2μ + 1` contacts,
which is the bound later used for `L`.
