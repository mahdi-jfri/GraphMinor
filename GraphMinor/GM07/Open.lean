/-- A surface `S_e` with associated surjection `φ_e : S_e → S` and cut graph
`G_e = φ_e⁻¹(G \ e)` is obtained from `(S, G)` by deleting a non-loop edge `e ∈ G.E` with
`closure e ∩ bd S = ∅` and cutting `S` along `closure e`
(Graph Minors VII, Section 7, page 238: "If $e$ is an edge of $G$, let $G \setminus e$ be the graph
obtained from $G$ by deleting $e$. Let $\Sigma_e$ be the surface obtained from $\Sigma$ by cutting
along $\bar{e}$. Let $\phi_e$ be the associated surjection. Then $\phi_e^{-1}(G \setminus e)$ is a
proper graph in $\Sigma_e$; and provided $\bar{e} \cap bd(\Sigma) = \emptyset$ and $e$ is not a
loop, we have $\Sigma_e \cong \Sigma(a, b, c + 1)$.").

The last four fields say what cutting means. Off `e` the map is one to one, so each end of `e` has one point over it. The
preimage of `closure e` is a new cuff. Pasting a disc on the new cuff gives `S` back,
and the inclusion is homotopic to `φ_e`. Without these fields `φ_e` could collapse a small cuff to a point of `S`, far from `e`,
and (7.1) and (7.2) would fail. -/
