# Small connected approaches in a surface

In VII (4.6), page 228, `ψ` has one point over a point of `bd(Σ′)` off the
matching. The reason is local: a boundary point has small
neighbourhoods which stay connected once the boundary is removed. In a
half-plane chart such a neighbourhood contains an open half ball, which is
convex and lies off the boundary, and is dense in what remains.
