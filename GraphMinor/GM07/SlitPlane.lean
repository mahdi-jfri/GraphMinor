# Opening a slit in the unit ball

To cut a surface along a line we work in a chart in which the line is the segment `[-s, s]` of the real axis, and we
remove the open ball of radius `s`. The map `slitMap s` of the closed unit ball is the identity on the unit circle.
It leaves the real part alone and scales the imaginary part by a factor that grows with the norm, from `0` at norm `s`
to `1` at norm `1`. So the circle of radius `s` is folded onto the segment, and off this circle the map is one to one
(`slitMap_eq`). Each vertical line is treated on its own, by the intermediate value theorem (`exists_slitMap_eq`).
