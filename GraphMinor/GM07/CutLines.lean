# Lifting a line through a cut

Let `θ` undo a cut, so that `θ` is one to one off a closed set `B`. An arc that meets `B` at most at its first point lifts to an arc (`exists_lift_arc`). The lift off `B` is forced. The point to prove is that the lift has one limit
at the first point, even though the fiber over it can have several points: the fiber is finite, and the preimage of a small piece of the arc is connected, so it stays near one point of the fiber.
