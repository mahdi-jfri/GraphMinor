# Graph Minors VII, Section 4: The Main Result, First Version

This file formalizes Section 4 (pages 221–230) of N. Robertson and P. D. Seymour,
*Graph Minors. VII. Disjoint paths on a surface*, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 45 (1988) 212–254:
- `(4.1)` (`theorem_4_1`): characterization of `G`-feasibility of a forest `H` in a closed disc `Δ`
  (Theorem (3.6) of Graph Minors VI, `GM06.Statement36`, stated in the language of `G`-normal
  proper `I`-arcs);
- `(4.2)` (`theorem_4_2`): an open connected subset `Y` of a connected boundaryless surface `Σ` in
  which every `O`-arc bounds a closed disc is either `Σ` (when `Σ` is a sphere) or an open disc
  (proved unconditionally from `Surface.open_disc`);
- `(4.3)` (`theorem_4_3`, in `Section43.lean`): existence of `v + 1` internally vertex-disjoint paths from a cuff `C` to
  `bd(Σ) - C` when every short boundary-disjoint `G`-normal `O`-arc is null-homotopic;
- `(4.4)` (`theorem_4_4`, in `Section44.lean`): moving a forest `H₀` by a homotopy off a forest `L` when
  cutting along `U(L)`;
- `(4.5)` (`theorem_4_5`): pullback and pushforward of forests and homoplasties across the
  surjection `φ : Σ' → Σ` obtained by cutting along `U(J)`;
- `vSurface_le_vModel`: unconditional bound `vSurface S k ≤ vModel a b c k`
  when `Nonempty (S ≃ₜ SurfaceModel a b c)`;
- `(4.6)`: first version of the main feasibility theorem on a connected surface with at least two
  cuffs. It is `theorem_4_6` in `GM07/Section46Final.lean`, because its proof needs much of this file.

/-- Graph Minors VII, (4.1) (page 221; Theorem (3.6) of Graph Minors VI, `GM06.Statement36`):
"(4.1) *Let $G$ be a proper graph in a closed disc $\Delta$ and let $H$ be a forest in $\Delta$
with $V(H) \cap bd(\Delta) = V(G) \cap bd(\Delta)$. Then $H$ is $G$-feasible if and only if for
every $G$-normal proper $I$-arc $F$ with ends $s, t$ say, $|V(G) \cap (F - \{s, t\})| \ge |\Lambda|$
where $C_1, C_2$ are the two components of $bd(\Delta) - \{s, t\}$, and $\Lambda$ is the set of
vertex sets of the components of $H$ which intersect both $C_1$ and $C_2$, and contain neither $s$
nor $t$.*" -/

disc included in $Y$. Then either $\Sigma$ is a sphere and $Y = \Sigma$, or $Y$ is an open disc.*"
