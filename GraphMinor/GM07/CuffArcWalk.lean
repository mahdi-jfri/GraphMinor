# The path of `G` from `C` to `A`, in (6.1)

Graph Minors VII, (6.1), page 238: "if $V(G) \cap C \ne \emptyset$ there is a path of $G$ between $C$ and $a_1$ not using $a_2$. (If $V(G) \cap C \ne \emptyset$ there is such a path, because $G$ is boundary-linked.)"

We fill in the reason. Suppose the vertices that a walk from the vertex of `C` can reach strictly inside `A` have no neighbour on `A`. Then we chart a neighbourhood of the disc into the sphere, and grow a disc from the pasted disc over these vertices with
`exists_disc_of_side`. Its boundary is an `O`-arc that surrounds `C` and misses `G`, against boundary-linkage.
