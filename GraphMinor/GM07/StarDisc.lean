# Star-shaped discs around a vertex

Near a point of a closed surface a drawing is a finite set of rays. For this we use the polar charts of
Graph Minors XI (`GM11.IsPolar`), which that paper builds at a vertex with at least two half-edges and at
a point of an edge. We add the vertices with fewer half-edges (`exists_isPolar_of_vertex`), so that every
vertex has a polar chart.

A round disc of a polar chart is a *star disc* (`IsStarDisc`): each closed union of atoms of the drawing
that meets the disc in a point `y` holds a connected set from `y` to the centre, which stays inside the
disc after it leaves `y`. This is all that we use. From it we read how lines and `O`-arcs of the drawing
cross the disc (`exists_ray`, `exists_chord`). They are used for Graph Minors VII, (3.4), claim (1)
(page 220), which thickens a forest to a family of discs.
