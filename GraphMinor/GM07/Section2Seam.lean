# Graph Minors VII, (2.1): seam graphs as printed

Graph Minors VII, (2.1) (page 215), says that a graph `J` in `Σ` is a seam graph for some net if
and only if

* (i) `bd(Σ) ⊆ U(J)`, and every edge of `J` is either included in `bd(Σ)` or disjoint from it;
* (ii) `J - bd(Σ)` has no isolated vertices;
* (iii) `J` has a unique region; and
* (iv) every `O`-arc included in that region is null-homotopic.

This file proves conditions (i) and (ii) for seam graphs; `theorem_2_1_forward`
(`GraphMinor/GM07/Section2.lean`) then gives the forward direction with all four conditions as
printed. Condition (ii) uses `deleteBd`, the paper's `J - bd(Σ)` from page 214,
which keeps every vertex of `J` and the edges of `J` that miss `bd(Σ)`. The two new facts are that
the open image of each pasted side is an edge of `J` that misses `bd(Σ)` (`Net.e_int_mem_E`,
`Net.disjoint_e_int_bd`), and that every other edge of `J` lies in `bd(Σ)`
(`Net.seamGraph_edges_eq`).

The printed converse is false. A seam graph needs a pair, since the paper defines it only "provided
that $\Pi \ne \emptyset$". The empty graph in the sphere satisfies (i)–(iv), and it has no vertex, so
it is not a seam graph (`not_theorem_2_1_proof`). A graph whose point set is not connected, such as two
disjoint edges in the sphere, is another counterexample, since the point set of a seam graph is the
image of a circle. The converse for `U(J)` connected is in `GraphMinor/GM07/Section2Converse.lean`.
If `U(J)` is not empty, then (i) and (ii) give an edge of `J` that misses `bd(Σ)`
(`exists_edge_disjoint_bd_of_nonempty`).

/-- Condition (i) of Graph Minors VII, (2.1) (page 215), for a seam graph. The pasted sides give
edges that miss `bd(Σ)`, and every other edge is a piece of `bd(Σ)` (`seamGraph_edges_eq`). This is
the paper's "the sets $\{f_i(x) \colon 0 < x < 1\}$ $(1 \le i \le r)$ are all edges of $J$, and each
is disjoint from $bd(\Sigma)$; and any other edge of $J$ is included in $bd(\Sigma)$" (page 216). -/

isolated vertices. Each vertex of `J` is an end `φ(f_i(0))` or `φ(f_i(1))` of some pair, and the
open image of `f_i` is an edge of `J` that misses `bd(Σ)` and has this vertex in its closure. -/

is either a vertex or lies on an edge, and every edge has an end. By (ii) this vertex is the end of an
edge of `J - bd(Σ)`, which is an edge of `J` that misses `bd(Σ)`. -/
