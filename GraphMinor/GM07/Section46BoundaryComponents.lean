# Components of the retained graph together with the cuffs

For the cuff count in VII (4.6), page 226, the components of
`U(L) ∪ bd(Σ)` form a finite closed family. Cover this set by the
vertices and closed edges of `L`, and the finitely many original cuffs.
Each covering set is connected. Finite component families also have
closed remainders, which is needed to lift each part through the cut.
