# A seam circle cannot bound a disc in the original surface

In the circle argument of VII (4.6), page 226, a disc bounded by a
circle in the seam has the unique dense region entirely on one side.
It must contain the whole surface. A surface with at least two cuffs
is not a closed disc, so such a circle cannot be null-homotopic there.
This leaves the capped-cuff alternative of hypothesis (ii).
