# The new vertices on each closed seam edge

In VII (4.6), page 225, `W(e)` lies inside the old edge `e`.
Different old edges are disjoint. No point of `W` is an old vertex,
so intersecting `W` with a closed long edge gives exactly its own
pair of cut points. This identifies the marked local drawing in `J⁺`.
