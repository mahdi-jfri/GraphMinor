# Maps between capped surfaces

A homeomorphism of the boundaries of two closed discs extends to the discs, radially (`exists_radial`). So a map of surfaces
that is one to one between two cuffs extends to the surfaces with discs pasted on these cuffs (`exists_cap_map`). In particular
two ways of pasting a disc on a cuff are the same (`IsPlanarInCappedCuff.of_cap`).

`isPlanar_of_homotopy` says when a solid set is planar: each `O`-arc of it is homotopic into a closed disc. With this we compare a
set with its image under a map homotopic to the identity, without moving the discs.
