# Models of minors, and graphs as hypergraphs

Graph Minors IV, Section 7 (pages 242–243), describes when a graph `G` is isomorphic to a minor of
a graph `G'`: "each edge $e$ of $G$ is represented by an edge $\eta(e)$ of $G'$, and each vertex $v$
of $G$ is “formed” by identifying under contraction a nonempty subset $\eta(v)$ of the vertex set of
$G'$. Moreover, there is a connected subgraph of $G'$ with vertex set $\eta(v)$ all edges of which are
to be contracted in producing this minor. Thus, in summary:

(i) $\eta$ is a function with domain $V(G) \cup E(G)$; for each $v \in V(G)$, $\eta(v)$ is a non-empty subset
of $V(G')$ and for each $e \in E(G)$, $\eta(e) \in E(G')$ ...
(ii) $\eta(v_1) \cap \eta(v_2) = \emptyset$ for distinct $v_1, v_2 \in V(G)$, and $\eta(e_1) \neq \eta(e_2)$ for distinct
$e_1, e_2 \in E(G)$
(iii) for each $v \in V(G)$ and $e \in E(G)$, $e$ is incident with $v$ in $G$ if and only if $\eta(v)$
contains an end of $\eta(e)$ in $G'$, and $e$ is a loop of $G$ with end $v$ if and only if $\eta(v)$
contains every end of $\eta(e)$ in $G'$
(iv) for each $v \in V(G)$ there is a connected subgraph of $G' \setminus \eta(E(G))$ with vertex set $\eta(v)$."

`IsMinorModel H G ηv ηe` says that `ηv` (on vertices) and `ηe` (on edges) satisfy (i)–(iv), with
`H` in the role of the paper's `G` and `G` in the role of `G'`. `MinorModelStatement` says that a
model gives a minor; Graph Minors IV uses it to deduce (1.5) from (9.1), and Graph Minors XX uses
it for (10.5).

`Hypergraph.ofGraph` views a finite graph (Mathlib's `Graph`) as a hypergraph whose edges have one
or two ends.
