# A finger of a closed disc

Let `E` be a closed disc in a closed surface, let `K ⊆ E` be compact, and let `x ∈ K` be off `bd(E)`. Let a
line run from a point outside `E` to `x`, and meet `K` only in `x`. We remove from `E` a thin finger along the
line, up to `x`. Then `E` stays a closed disc that holds `K`, and `x` joins the points of `K` on the boundary
(`exists_finger`). We repeat this in `exists_disc_around`, to bring a finite set of points of `K` to the
boundary.

To make the finger, take a parallel copy of the line, by `exists_parallel_line`. The last parts of the two
lines, from where they enter `E`, form a chord through `x`. In one half of `E` we use coordinates in which
the chord is straight. In those coordinates the finger is the region under a graph, of height at most half
the distance to `K`.
