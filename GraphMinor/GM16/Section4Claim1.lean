# Claim (1) in the proof of XVI (4.2)

The paper defines the wall tangle by placing a complete horizontal
row on the large side. Contracting the horizontal pairs induces a
tangle from the smaller grid. Its small side contains no complete
wall row. Every separation of order less than `θ` has an uncut row,
so the two definitions of the tangle agree.
