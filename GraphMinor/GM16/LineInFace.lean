# Locating a normal circle's lines in faces

After splitting a normal circle at its at most two drawing vertices,
each open line avoids the drawing and is connected. It lies in one
region. Taking its closure puts the whole line in the region closure,
and only its ends can meet that face's boundary. These are the local
face data used in the rigidity check of XVI (4.2).
