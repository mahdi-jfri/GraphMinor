# Choosing the forest in XVI (5.3)

Choose a subgraph with as few edges as possible while keeping the marked
vertices in the same components. A spanning forest of this subgraph keeps
the required connections and has no more edges. Minimality makes it the
whole subgraph, proving that the chosen subgraph is a forest.
