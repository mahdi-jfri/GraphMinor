# No small separator between the nested zone boundaries

The radial form of the planar Menger step in XVI (8.1), Claim (10),
marks the radial regions of the inner separation side. That side is
small in the tangle. Its radial boundary captures an edge at the
centre, so one of its circuits encloses the inner open zone. The
circuit has at most twice as many edges as separator vertices. The
short radial enclosure contradiction then rules it out.
