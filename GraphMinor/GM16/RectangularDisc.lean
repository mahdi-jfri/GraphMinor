# Closed rectangles as discs

The rectangular faces of the wall are closed discs. Transfer the
rectangle theorem in complex coordinates to real coordinate pairs,
then carry the disc through the embedding used for the sphere
wall drawing. The interior of its image is contained in the image
of the open rectangle, which is the inclusion needed to check
that it misses the drawing.
