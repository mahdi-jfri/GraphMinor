# Paths in a two-cell drawing

The point set of a two-cell drawing in a connected closed surface does not
split into two disjoint nonempty closed sets. Partitioning it according to
which vertices can be reached by graph walks therefore shows that any two
vertices are joined by a walk. This supplies the paths chosen in XVI (8.3).
