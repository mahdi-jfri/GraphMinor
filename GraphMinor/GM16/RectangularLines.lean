# Straight sides of rectangles

Parametrising a horizontal or vertical side by its varying
coordinate proves it is a line. Unlike the unit lattice lines,
these sides can have any positive length. They are used when
joining rows of wall bricks into the disc bounded by the wall's
outer boundary in XVI (4.2).
