# The surface tower

We prove `SurfaceTowerStatement`, which Graph Minors XVI, (3.1) needs (page 54).

Fix a finite graph `L`. By `Draw.exists_canBeDrawn`, there is `L₀` such that `L` can be drawn in every model `Σ(a, b, 0)` with `L₀ ≤ a` or `L₀ ≤ b`. So a surface in which `L` cannot be drawn has `2 a + b ≤ 3 L₀`. Adding a crosscap raises `2 a + b` by one (`crosscap_model`), and adding a handle raises it by two (`handle_model`). So the tower lists every model `Σ(a, b, 0)` with `2 a + b ≤ N`, for `N = 3 L₀ + 2`, in the order of `2 a + b`. The surface after a step is homeomorphic to a later member of the list, and spans move along homeomorphisms by `IsSigmaSpan.transport`.
