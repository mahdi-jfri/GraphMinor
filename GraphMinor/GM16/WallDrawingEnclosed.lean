# The whole even wall is inside its enclosed disc

The row and side inclusions cover all coordinates of wall vertices
and all closed unit edge lines. The specified vertex and edge maps
of the sphere drawing therefore place its entire support in the
embedded enclosed disc. This makes the complementary disc empty
of drawing in its interior, as required for the outer face of
XVI (4.2).
