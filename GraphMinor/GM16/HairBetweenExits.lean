# An old hair and two exit paths contain a new hair

Join the old hair to the paths taking its two old ends to the
cleared drawing. The connected union meets that drawing only at
the two new ends and has no edge there. A path in the union is
therefore a hair of the cleared drawing. This supplies the graph
step in XVI (7.1), Claim (6), page 70.
