# Rigidity of the sphere wall drawing

All face closures are discs. Common points of two brick closures
are joined by a line in their convex coordinate intersection.
For a brick and the outside face, use the boundary arc calculations.
The disc-face criterion then proves that the even wall drawing is
rigid, supplying the assertion in XVI (4.2), page 53.
