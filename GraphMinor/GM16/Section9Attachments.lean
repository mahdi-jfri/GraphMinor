# Trimming the attachment paths in XVI (8.1)

For Claim (9), an attachment from a boundary set to the bad path can
be trimmed at its last boundary vertex and first vertex of that path.
Its only vertex in the cleared drawing is then its initial vertex.
A simple path with only one vertex in a subgraph has no edge there.
