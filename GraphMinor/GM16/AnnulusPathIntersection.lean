# The clean path meets the annular subdrawing

A path from inside the outer zone to outside it contains a vertex
on that zone boundary. Since the inner closed zone lies strictly
inside the outer zone, this vertex belongs to the annular subdrawing.
This is the intersection assertion in XVI (8.1), Claim (14).
