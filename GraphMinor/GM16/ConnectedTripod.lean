# Three paths from one branch vertex

For the subcubic-minor step of XVI (4.2), page 54, a branch set has
at most three attachment vertices. Join two by a path. Join the third
to that path, stopping at its first meeting, and split the first path
there. The three resulting arms meet only at that vertex. Attachment
vertices may coincide, in which case some arms have one vertex.
