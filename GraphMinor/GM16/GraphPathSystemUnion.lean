# The union graph of a path system

The subdivision subgraph in XVI (4.2), page 54, consists of the
replacement paths and all branch centres. The separate centre set
keeps isolated source vertices. Restrict to precisely the path edges
so that the union has no additional edges from the ambient graph.
