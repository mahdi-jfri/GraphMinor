# The other disc bounded by a circle in a sphere

The sphere disc theorem supplies two complementary discs with a
given boundary. Its uniqueness clause identifies a given disc as
one of them. The other is the closure of its complement. This
constructs the closed outer face from the disc enclosed by the
wall in XVI (4.2).
