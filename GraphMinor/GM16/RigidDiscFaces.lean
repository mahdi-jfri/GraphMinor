# Rigidity from disc faces and their common boundary lines

Split a normal circle at two points containing all its drawing
vertices. Each open half lies in one face. If the faces coincide,
the circle bounds an empty dial in that face. Otherwise their two
common points lie on the drawing. A common boundary line joins
them, and the two-face construction gives a dial. This reduces the
wall rigidity check in XVI (4.2) to its face geometry.

/-- A drawing with disc faces and boundary lines joining common face
points is rigid. The hypotheses describe the face closures and their
intersections, rather than assume dials for normal circles. -/
