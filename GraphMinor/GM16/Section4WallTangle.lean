# The grid-induced tangle in the wall

In Claim (1) of XVI (4.2), page 53, contract the horizontal pairs of
the wall to obtain a square grid. X (7.3) supplies its tangle. Relabel
that tangle by the actual contraction maps, then apply X (6.1) to
induce a tangle of the same order in the wall. All the maps remain
explicit, so the chosen row edges can be compared in the next step.
