# A drawing supported on a line is a path

Join the two ends by a simple graph walk. Its drawing is a subdrawing
supported on a subline with the same ends. The interval property forces
that subline to be the whole line. A subdrawing with the same support
has all vertices and hence is the original drawing. This justifies the
path condition in the rigidity argument of XVI (4.2).
