# Plane coordinates on a surface disc

Compose the extended complex chart with the standard identification
of the complex plane and the Euclidean plane. The chart inverse
preserves every closed disc inside the chart, including its boundary.
These are the discs of the rural presentation in XVI (8.1), Claim (11).
