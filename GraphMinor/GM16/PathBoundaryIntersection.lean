# A path meets a drawn boundary only at its boundary vertices

If a path has only one vertex on a boundary subdrawing, it has no
edge there. Their point-set intersection is consequently their
vertex intersection. This is used when trimming Claim (10)'s paths
into the battlefield disc for XVI (8.1), Claim (11).
