# A union of paths from one centre is connected

Every vertex on an arm can reach the centre along a subpath of
that arm. These walks lie in the union graph. Joining two such
walks at the centre proves graph connectivity. Keeping the centre
as a separate vertex also covers the case of no arms. This is
the branch graph used for the subdivision minor in XVI (4.2).
