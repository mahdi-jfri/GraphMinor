# Intersections between arms for distinct minor edges

In XVI (4.2), page 54, arms in different branch sets are disjoint.
Two arms in the same branch set come from different neighbours when
the model edges differ. They therefore meet only at the branch centre.
This proves that the paths replacing different minor edges can meet
only at branch centres.
