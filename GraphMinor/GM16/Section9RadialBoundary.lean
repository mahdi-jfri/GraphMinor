# The radial boundary of an annular separation

The separator in XVI (8.1), Claim (10), separates the inner disc
from the outside of the battlefield. Mark the radial regions that
contain edges on its inner side. Their boundary stays in the outer
disc closure and misses the inner open disc. Both assertions follow
by looking at an incident radial region on the appropriate side.
