# The disc enclosed by the wall's outer boundary

In each even row the bricks fill the horizontal interval from zero
to `2θ`. In each odd row they fill the interval from one to `2θ-1`.
Stacking those rectangles gives a disc, since consecutive rows
have an overlap of positive length when `θ ≥ 2`. This is the
bounded side of the outer boundary in the rigidity check of
XVI (4.2), page 53.
