# The wall minor controlled by the tangle

Use the large square grid supplied by Robertson, Seymour and Thomas,
then keep its rectangular wall. The wall rows are exactly the first
`θ` rows of that square grid. Thus no small side of the original tangle
contains a complete wall row. This is Step (2) and the following
restriction in XVI (4.2), page 53.
