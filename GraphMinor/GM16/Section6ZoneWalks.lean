# Connections inside a zone in XVI (6.3)

A zone boundary is a circuit of the drawing. A drawing path from a
vertex in the closed zone to that circuit can be stopped at its first
boundary vertex, and all its edges up to that point stay in the closed
zone. Paths along the boundary then join any two vertices in the closed
zone. In (6.3), these are the far ends `v(y)`, correcting the printed
occurrence of `Y₄` on page 60.
