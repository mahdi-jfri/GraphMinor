# Every wall face has a disc closure

The face classification gives either a brick interior or the
outside disc interior. Each has its stated disc as closure. Since
its interior is a region, any drawing point in that closed disc
lies on the disc boundary. This verifies the disc-face hypothesis
of the rigidity criterion for the wall in XVI (4.2).
