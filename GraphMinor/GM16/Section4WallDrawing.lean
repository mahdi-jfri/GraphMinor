# Drawing the wall in any sphere

The wall retains all horizontal grid edges and alternate vertical
ones. It is therefore a subgraph of the rectangular grid. Place that
grid's coordinate plane in the sphere and use its unit-line drawing.
The graph isomorphism and all edge closures are kept explicit for the
subdivision and rigidity steps of XVI (4.2), pages 53–54.
