# A stack of overlapping rows is a disc

Start with the bottom rectangle. A new row meets the preceding
stack in the overlap of their horizontal sides. Positive overlap
makes that side a line, and the rectangle append lemma proves that
the union is still a disc. This constructs the enclosed disc for
the outer face of the wall in XVI (4.2).
