# The degree bounds in XVI (5.4)

A path has at most one neighbor at either end and at most two neighbors
at any vertex. Splitting at the vertex reduces the latter fact to the
former. These bounds exclude a fan of five paths in the union of the
spokes and the disjoint paths away from the common start.
