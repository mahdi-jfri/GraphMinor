# Graph Minors XVI (4.2): a sphere span

Increase the desired order to an even height at least four.
The row-defined wall tangle and the controlled grid minor give a
wall minor whose induced tangle is contained in the ambient one.
Replace its subcubic branch sets by centres and disjoint arms,
retaining the same chosen edges inside the subdivision subgraph.
Draw that subdivision rigidly on the sphere wall's support.
The identical chosen edge map compares the two induced tangles,
and transporting the subdivision tangle to its drawing gives the
required controlled respectful tangle and hence the sphere span.

/-- Graph Minors XVI, (4.2), pages 53–54. Every sufficiently high-order
graph tangle has a sphere span of the prescribed order. The wall,
subdivision, drawing, and induced-tangle steps of the paper are all
proved; the initial height is increased to an even value at least four. -/
