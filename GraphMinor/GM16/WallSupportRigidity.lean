# Rigidity for drawings with the wall's support

The disc-face and common-line geometry of the wall depends on its
support rather than its marked vertices. A drawing obtained by
putting more vertices on its edge lines has the same regions and
face closures. The disc-face criterion therefore proves rigidity
for the subdivision drawing in XVI (4.2).
