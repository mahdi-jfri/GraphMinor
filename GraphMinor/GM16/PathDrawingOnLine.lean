# Drawing an abstract path on a prescribed line

Choose as many marked points on the line as the path has vertices,
including both ends. The existing line drawing construction gives
a drawing supported on that line. It is a path, and matching the
ordered vertex positions gives an isomorphism with the abstract
path that preserves both ends. This draws the replacing paths
of the subdivision in XVI (4.2).
