# Unions of hair graphs in XVI (6.3)

Each truncated hair meets the embedded drawing at its own near end.
Thus a drawing vertex in their union has at most one neighbor. For the
second application of (5.3), joining all full hair paths to a connected
subgraph containing their far ends gives a connected graph.
