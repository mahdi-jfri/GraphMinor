# Graph Minors XVI (5.5)

Choose the threshold from (5.2) and double it. Claim (1), proved in
Section5Linkage, supplies the required number of disjoint old-graph paths
with separated ends. Their disjointness also makes all these ends
distinct, so (5.2) gives the controlled clique minor.

/-- **Graph Minors XVI, (5.5)** (pages 57–58), by the paper's induction
on disjoint paths and then (5.2). The metric laws are supplied by XI (9.1),
and (5.2) uses XII (4.4). No statement of XVI is assumed. -/
