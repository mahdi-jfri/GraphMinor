# Dials whose intersection with a drawing is a line

In the sphere-wall proof of XVI (4.2), a disc bounded by a normal
circle either misses the drawing in its interior, or meets it in
a line between the two boundary vertices. In the latter case the
restricted drawing is a path, by the line-to-path lemma. This file
supplies that last conversion without a graph connectivity assumption.
