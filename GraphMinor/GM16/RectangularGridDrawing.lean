# The straight-line drawing of a grid subgraph

Place every vertex at its lattice point and use the assigned unit
lines for edges. The endpoint and intersection checks show that the
finite-line construction applies. The resulting graph drawing has
exactly the prescribed vertex map and edge closures. This includes
the alternating-edge wall used in XVI (4.2), page 53.
