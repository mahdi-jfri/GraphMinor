# Metrics for the spans in Graph Minors XVI

A respectful tangle has a metric. Choose a radial drawing. Each short circuit of
that drawing is a normal circle meeting the original drawing in fewer than the
tangle order many vertices. Respectfulness chooses its inside disc. These choices
give the derived slope used in the definition of the tangle metric.

/-- The metric used in Graph Minors XVI, Section 4, page 52, exists for every
respectful tangle in a closed surface. It is obtained from a radial drawing and
the inside discs supplied by respectfulness, as in XI, Section 6, page 87. -/
