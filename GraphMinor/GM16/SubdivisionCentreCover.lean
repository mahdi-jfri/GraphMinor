# Branch centres occur on replacing paths

If the original graph has no isolated vertices, choose an edge
incident with each vertex. Its replacing path contains that
vertex's centre as one of its ends. Thus the replacing paths
already contain all centres, and no separate isolated-vertex
piece is needed when gluing the wall subdivision drawing.
