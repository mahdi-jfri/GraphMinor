# Tangles in sphere drawings are respectful

An `O`-arc in a sphere bounds two complementary closed discs.
If it meets a drawing only at fewer than `θ` vertices, those discs
give a separation of order less than `θ`. The first tangle axiom
chooses one side. This proves the respectfulness used for the sphere
span at the end of XVI (4.2), page 54.
