# Lines under embeddings between different spaces

Parametrise a line by a closed interval and compose its parametrisation
with the embedding. The resulting arc has the image line as its range
and the images of the original ends as its ends. This is used to move
the wall's coordinate lines into a sphere in XVI (4.2).
