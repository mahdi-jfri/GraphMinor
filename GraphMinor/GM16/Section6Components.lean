# Components containing two marked vertices

In XVI (6.3), pages 59–60, `Y₁` consists of the marked vertices in
components containing at least two marked vertices. Outside these
components, connected hair graphs with different marked near ends are
disjoint. We express the components by walks to avoid choosing names for
the individual components.
