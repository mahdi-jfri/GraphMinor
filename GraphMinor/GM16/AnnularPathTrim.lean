# Trimming a path at an inner circle

Keep the subpath from its outside end to its first vertex on the
inner circle. It has no other vertex on that circuit and no edge of
the circuit, so its point set also meets the circle only at that end.
Connectedness then keeps it outside the inner disc. This is the
trimming used for linkedness in XVI (8.1), Claim (11).
