# Connectivity through a connected boundary

In a connected graph, suppose a subgraph retains every edge incident
with one of its vertices away from a chosen boundary. Following any
ambient walk to the boundary gives a walk inside the subgraph up to
its first boundary vertex. If the boundary vertices are connected
inside the subgraph, the whole subgraph is connected. This is the
graph argument behind the connected annulus in XVI (8.1), Claim (14).
