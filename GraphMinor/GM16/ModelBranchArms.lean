# Branch arms in a subcubic minor model

For a vertex of the wall in XVI (4.2), page 54, choose the end of
each incident model edge in its branch set. There are at most three
such occurrences. Construct arms to them in the connected branch
graph supplied by the model. The arms use none of the chosen model
edges, and two arms at the same branch centre meet only there, even
when two chosen edges have the same attachment vertex.
