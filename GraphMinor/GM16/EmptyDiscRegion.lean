# An empty disc with drawing boundary is a face

The open part of such a disc lies in one region by connectedness.
That region cannot cross the disc boundary, because the boundary
belongs to the drawing. It is therefore exactly the disc interior,
and its closure is the whole disc. This identifies the brick faces
in the wall rigidity proof of XVI (4.2).
