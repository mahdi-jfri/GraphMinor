# Positions along a graph path

Enumerate the vertices and edges of a walk by their positions in
its two lists. The edge at position `i` joins the vertices at
positions `i` and `i+1`. For a simple walk these enumerations are
injective. They provide the endpoint-preserving isomorphisms used
to draw the replacing paths of the subdivision in XVI (4.2).
