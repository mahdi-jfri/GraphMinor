# Containment from nested boundaries

Inside a fixed closed disc a circle bounds only one closed disc.
Consequently, a smaller closed disc is contained in any other closed
disc there that contains its boundary. This places the battlefield's
inner disc inside the discs of the nest in XVI (8.1), Claim (11).
