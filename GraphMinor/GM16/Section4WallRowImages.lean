# Rows and the contraction in XVI (4.2)

The surviving edges of a contracted horizontal row come from the
corresponding wall row. A small side of the induced grid tangle cannot
contain a full wall row, since its image would contain a grid column.
X (7.1) then supplies a grid row on that same small side, a contradiction.
