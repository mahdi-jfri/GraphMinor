# Adding a row to a disc made of rectangles

The union of the wall's brick rows is a disc. At each step the new
row meets the previous rows in a horizontal interval at their top
height. Coordinate bounds put this interval on both disc boundaries,
so the disc union theorem applies. This file proves that step for
the coordinate embedding into a closed surface.
