# Paths of a drawing and its hypergraph skeleton

Menger's theorem is stated for the skeleton of a hypergraph. A drawing
has the same finite hypergraph whether it is first viewed as a graph
or directly as a hypergraph. A skeleton path therefore traces a path
subdrawing with exactly the same vertices.
