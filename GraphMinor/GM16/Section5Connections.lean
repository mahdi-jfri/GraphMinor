# Connections after removing the common start in XVI (5.4)

A spoke meeting a path that avoids its start joins its other end to
both ends of that path after the common start is removed. At least one
of those two ends differs from the spoke end. This identifies the spokes
that avoid all the given paths in the last paragraph of (5.4).
