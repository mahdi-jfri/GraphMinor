# Placing small discs in a closed disc

The last step of (11.11) of Graph Minors IX places a closed disc for each small clique of a rural
neighborhood, so that the discs meet only at common vertices. This file holds the plane facts that
step needs.

A closed disc contains a smaller closed disc that meets its boundary in any given finite set
(`exists_inscribed_disc`). Each point of a closed disc lies on the boundary of an arbitrarily small
closed disc that meets the outer boundary at most there (`exists_small_disc_at`). Finitely many
lines can be thickened one after another to closed discs that meet only at common ends
(`exists_lenses`).
