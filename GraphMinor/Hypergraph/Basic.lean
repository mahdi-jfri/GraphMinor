# Hypergraphs, separations and rooted hypergraphs

This file gives the basic definitions of Graph Minors IV, Section 3 (page 233), which Graph Minors
XVIII and XX repeat:

> A hypergraph `G` consists of a finite set `V(G)` of vertices, a finite set `E(G)` of edges with
> `E(G) ∩ V(G) = ∅`, and an incidence relation, a subset of `V(G) × E(G)`. The vertices incident
> with an edge `e` are its *ends*, and the set of ends of `e` in `G` is denoted by `V(e)`. If `G`,
> `G'` are hypergraphs and `V(G') ⊆ V(G)` and `E(G') ⊆ E(G)`, and `V_G(e) = V_{G'}(e)` for every
> `e ∈ E(G')`, then we call `G'` a *subhypergraph* of `G` and write `G' ⊆ G`. If `G₁, G₂ ⊆ G` we
> define `G₁ ∩ G₂`, `G₁ ∪ G₂` in the natural way. A *separation* of `G` is a pair `(G₁, G₂)` of
> subhypergraphs of `G` with `G₁ ∪ G₂ = G` and `E(G₁ ∩ G₂) = ∅`; its *order* is
> `|V(G₁ ∩ G₂)|`.
>
> A march in a set `V` is a finite sequence of distinct elements of `V`. ... A *rooted
> hypergraph* `G = (G⁻, π(G))` consists of a hypergraph `G⁻` and a march `π(G)` in `V(G⁻)`. ...
> A separation of a rooted hypergraph `G` is a pair `(G₁, G₂)` of rooted hypergraphs such that
> `(G₁⁻, G₂⁻)` is a separation of `G⁻`, and `π(G₂) = π(G)`, and `π̄(G₁) = V(G₁⁻ ∩ G₂⁻)`.

Vertices lie in a type `α` and edges in a type `β`, so the condition `E(G) ∩ V(G) = ∅` is
automatic. A march is a `List` without duplicates.

It also defines paths, which the papers use in Menger's theorem: a hypergraph `G` has the simple
graph `G.skeleton` on its vertices, in which two distinct vertices are adjacent when some edge is
incident with both (the *1-skeleton* of Graph Minors XX, Section 10, and the graph `K` in the proof
of Graph Minors IV, (6.1)). For a graph, the paths of `G` and of `G.skeleton` have the same vertex
sequences, so disjoint paths of `G` are disjoint paths of `G.skeleton`. `MengerStatement` is
Menger's theorem in the form that Graph Minors IV uses in the proof of (6.1).
