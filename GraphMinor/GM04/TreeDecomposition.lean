# Tree-decompositions of rooted hypergraphs (Graph Minors IV, Sections 3 and 5)

Graph Minors IV, Section 3 (page 234): "A *tree-decomposition* $(T, \tau)$ of a rooted hypergraph $G$ consists of a tree $T$ and a function $\tau$ which assigns to each $t \in V(T)$ a rooted hypergraph $\tau(t)$, such that

(i) for each $t \in V(T)$, $\tau(t)^- \subseteq G^-$

(ii) $\bigcup_{t \in V(T)} \tau(t)^- = G^-$

(iii) for distinct $t_1, t_2 \in V(T)$, $E(\tau(t_1)^- \cap \tau(t_2)^-) = \emptyset$

(iv) for $t_1, t_2, t_3 \in V(T)$, if $t_2$ lies on the path of $T$ between $t_1$ and $t_3$ then $\tau(t_1)^- \cap \tau(t_3)^- \subseteq \tau(t_2)^-$

(v) $\pi(\tau(o(T))) = \pi(G)$

(vi) for each edge $f \in E(T)$ with head $t_1$ and tail $t_2$, $\bar{\pi}(\tau(t_1)) = V(\tau(t_1)^- \cap \tau(t_2)^-)$."

"If $T'$ is a subtree of $T$ we denote by $\tau \times T'$ the rooted hypergraph $G'$ defined by
$$
G'^- = \bigcup_{t \in V(T')} \tau(t)^-
$$
$$
\pi(G') = \pi(\tau(o(T'))).
$$" Here `cross τ S r` is `τ × T'` for the
subtree `T'` with vertex set `S` and root `r`.

(3.1) says that for an edge `f` of `T`, `(τ × T^f, τ × T_f)` is a separation of `G`; "The order of the separation in (3.1) is called the *order* of $f$ in $(T, \tau)$." (`edgeOrder`).

Section 5 (page 238): "The width of a tree-decomposition $(T, \tau)$ of a rooted hypergraph $G$ is

$$\max(|V(\tau(t))| - 1 : t \in V(T))$$

and the *tree-width* of $G$ is the minimum $w \ge 0$ such that $G$ has a tree-decomposition of width $\le w$." `WidthLE T τ w` says that the width is at most `w`, and
`TreeWidthLE G w` that the tree-width is at most `w`. In `TreeWidthLE` the tree has vertices in
`ℕ`; every finite tree is isomorphic to one with vertices in `ℕ`, so this loses nothing.

`ThomasStatement` is the lemma of R. Thomas that Graph Minors IV quotes as (5.1).

tree-decomposition $(T, \tau)$ of width $\le w$ such that for all distinct $t_1$, $t_2 \in
V(T)$ and all $k \ge 0$ either there are $k$ mutually vertex-disjoint paths of $G$ from
