# Rooted trees (Graph Minors IV, Section 2)

Graph Minors IV, Section 2 (page 230): "we define an *undirected tree* to be a non-null connected finite undirected graph without circuits, and a *tree* $T$ to be a directed graph, the undirected graph underlying which is an undirected tree, such that every vertex of $T$ is the head of at most one edge. It follows that there is a unique vertex of each tree $T$ (called the *root* and denoted by $o(T)$) which is the head of no edge of $T$, and every edge of $T$ is directed away from the root."

## How a tree is represented

A `RootedTree ι` has a finite vertex set `verts` in the type `ι`, a root, and a function `parent`.
Every vertex `v` other than the root is the head of exactly one edge, and the tail of that edge is
`parent v`. Since an edge is determined by its head, **we identify each edge with its head**: the
edge set `E(T)` is `T.edges`, the vertex set minus the root, and the edge `f` has head `f` and tail
`T.parent f`. The condition that iterating `parent` from any vertex reaches the root says that the
underlying undirected graph is connected; it then has `|V(T)| - 1` edges, so it is a tree.
Conversely every tree in the sense of the paper arises in this way, with `parent v` the tail of
the edge with head `v`.

All trees of this file live in one type `ι`, so a sequence of disjoint trees, as in (2.1) and
(2.2), is a sequence of trees in `ι` with pairwise disjoint vertex sets, and subtrees and the
contraction of a tree are trees in the same type.

## Notions

* `T.Reaches u v`: there is a directed path of `T` from `u` to `v`, that is, `u` lies on the path
  of `T` from `o(T)` to `v` (possibly `u = v`).
* `T.subtreeAt v`: the vertex set of `T^v`, the maximal subtree of `T` with root `v`. For an edge
  `f`, `T^f = T^{head f}` is `T.subtreeAt f`, and `T.rootSide f` is the vertex set of `T_f`, the
  other component of `T \ f`, with root `o(T)`.
* `T.OnPath t₁ t₂ t`: `t` lies on the path of `T` between `t₁` and `t₂`. `T.OnPathEdge t₁ t₂ f`:
  the edge `f` is an edge of that path.
* `T.pathEdges f₂ f₁`: the edge set of the directed path of `T` with first edge `f₂` and last edge
  `f₁`. Such a path exists exactly when `T.Reaches f₂ f₁`.
* `T.Precedes φ v w`: `v` precedes `w` with respect to `φ`, as defined before (2.2).
* `T.IsComponentRoot F y x`, `T.componentAt F y`: `y` is the root of the component of `T \ F`
  containing `x`, and the vertex set of the component with root `y`.
* `T.IsContraction F S`: `S` is the contraction of `T` onto `F`, as defined before (2.2).
* `IsStar S`, `T.starAt s`: stars, and the maximal star with root `s` that is a subtree of `T`
  (Section 3).
* `IsRich M X`: `X` is `M`-rich. A set is `M`-stable when it is an independent set of `M`
  (Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.IsIndepSet`).
* `TreeLemma22Statement`: the statement of (2.2).

other than the root is the head of exactly one edge, whose tail is `parent v`; we identify this
edge with `v`. The value of `parent` at the root, and outside `verts`, carries no meaning; it is
the root at the root. -/

/-- `t` lies on the path of `T` between `t₁` and `t₂`. The common ancestors of `t₁` and `t₂` form a
directed path from the root, whose last vertex `a` is the vertex of the path between `t₁` and `t₂`
closest to the root; the path consists of the vertices from `a` to `t₁` and from `a` to `t₂`. So
`t` is on it when `t` lies on the path from the root to `t₁` or to `t₂`, and every common ancestor
of `t₁` and `t₂` lies on the path from the root to `t`. -/

w`, and `φ(g) ≥ φ(f)` for every edge `g` of `P`. The edges of `P` are the vertices `g ≠ v` with

root to `x`, `y` is the root of `T` or the head of an edge in `F`, and no other edge of the
directed path from `y` to `x` is in `F`. -/

/-- `S` is the contraction of `T` onto `F ⊆ E(T)` (Graph Minors IV, before (2.2)): "the tree $S$ with $E(S) = F$ and $V(S)$ the set of roots of the components of $T\setminus
F$, in which $v \in V(S)$ is the head (or tail, respectively) of $f \in F$ if the head (or
tail, respectively) of $f$ in $T$ belongs to the component of $T\setminus F$ with root $v$." The roots of the components of `T \ F` are
`o(T)` and the heads of the edges in `F`. The head of `f` in `T` is `f`, the root of its own
component, so `f` keeps its head; its tail in `S` is the root of the component containing its
tail `T.parent f` in `T`. -/

def IsRich (M : SimpleGraph ι) (X : Set ι) : Prop := ∀ Y ⊆ X, M.IsIndepSet Y → Y.Finite

/-- The statement of Graph Minors IV, (2.2). Let `T₁, T₂, …` be a countable sequence of disjoint
trees, let `n ≥ 0`, and for each `i` let `φᵢ : E(Tᵢ) → {0, 1, …, n}`. Let `M` be an infinite graph
with `V(M) = V(T₁ ∪ T₂ ∪ ⋯)` such that for `i' > i`, if `u ∈ V(Tᵢ)` is `M`-adjacent to
`w ∈ V(T_{i'})`, and `v ∈ V(T_{i'})` precedes `w` (with respect to `φ_{i'}`), then `u` is
`M`-adjacent to `v`. Let `{o(T₁), o(T₂), …}` be `M`-stable. Then there is an infinite `M`-stable
set `X ⊆ V(M)` such that `|X ∩ V(Tᵢ)| ≤ 1` for each `i` and such that the set of heads of all
edges of `T₁ ∪ T₂ ∪ ⋯` with tails in `X` is `M`-rich.

Here `M` is a simple graph on `ι`; only its adjacencies between vertices of the trees matter. The
sequence is indexed from `0`. -/
