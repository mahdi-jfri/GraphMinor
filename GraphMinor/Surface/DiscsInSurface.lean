# Closed discs in a surface

* `isOpen_image_of_manifold`: invariance of domain in a surface. So a closed disc of a surface minus
  its boundary is open (`IsChart.isOpen_image_ball`).
* `exists_sphere_map`: two closed discs that meet exactly in their common boundary form a sphere.
* `eq_of_discBd_eq`: in a connected surface that is not a sphere, a closed disc is determined by its
  boundary. Otherwise the two discs form a sphere that is open and closed in the surface.
* `isNullHomotopicOArcIn_of_subset_disc`: an `O`-arc in a closed disc inside `Z` is null-homotopic
  in `Z`.

The last two results are two of the three parts of `EpsteinStatement`.
