# Union and difference of closed discs

* `disc_union : DiscUnionStatement`: two closed discs that meet exactly in a line of both boundaries
  have a closed disc as union.
* `disc_difference : DiscDifferenceStatement`: the difference form.

For the union, cut the unit disc of `ℂ` along a diameter. By the extension theorem
`exists_bdMatch_closedInner`, each of the two discs has a homeomorphism onto one half that sends the
common line to the diameter by the same parametrization. These two maps agree on the line, so they
paste, since closed discs are closed in a Hausdorff space.

For the difference, take a chart of the larger disc. The boundary of the smaller disc is the line,
on the unit circle, together with a cross-cut of the circle. So the smaller disc is one side of the
cut, and the closure of the difference is the other side.
