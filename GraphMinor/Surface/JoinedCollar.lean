# Joining two collars

Three nested closed discs in a surface must share one radius coordinate. Keep the collar of the inner disc on radii at most two, and on radii from two to three use the collar of the middle disc after subtracting one from the radius.
The change of radius uses a denominator bounded below by two, so it gives a continuous map of the plane, also at zero. The collars agree along their common circle.
