# Removing open discs from a surface

Let `E` be a closed disc in a surface whose boundary lies in the interior of the surface. The surface without the inside of `E` is a
surface, and the boundary of `E` is a new cuff (`remove_disc`). At a point of the boundary of `E`, a small piece of the collar from
`exists_disc_collar` is a closed disc that is a neighbourhood of the point, which gives the chart.
