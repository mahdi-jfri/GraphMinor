# Compact connected curves

`exists_homeomorph_circle`: a compact connected Hausdorff space in which every point has a
neighbourhood that is an open interval is a circle.

The proof grows a closed arc. Take finitely many interval charts that cover the space, and let `N`
be the finite set of the ends of the charts. An end `q` of an arc lies in a chart. Near `q`, the arc
lies on one side of `q` in the chart, as it is connected. So we can walk from `q` along the other
side towards the end of the chart. Either we reach this end, and then the arc gained a point of `N`,
or we meet the arc again. By invariance of domain in dimension one, an interior point of the arc has
a neighbourhood in the arc, so we can only meet the other end of the arc. Then we have a circle. The
circle is open and closed, so it is the whole space.
