# The closure of an open disc

The operations of adding a crosscap or a handle remove an open disc `Λ` from a surface, and they say nothing about its closure. Here we show that the closure is a closed disc, if the frontier of `Λ` is an `O`-arc with points outside the closure of `Λ` arbitrarily near each of its points (`closure_disc`).

By `side_manifold`, the closure of `Λ` is a surface with the frontier as its boundary, so by the classification it has a model with one hole. To see that this model is a disc, we paste a disc on the hole. The result is the union of a closed disc around the pasted disc and a closed disc in `Λ`, which exists by Epstein's theorem. So the result is a sphere, and the classification says that the model is a disc (`model_genus_zero`).
