# A thin disc along a line of the boundary

Let `K` be a line in the boundary of a surface, and let `Z` be a closed set that meets `K` at most in its ends. We find a closed disc that
has `K` in its boundary, meets the boundary of the surface exactly in `K`, and meets `Z` at most in the ends of `K` (`exists_wedge`). The
disc is a wedge in a collar of the cuff of `K`: paste a disc on the cuff, and use the collar of that disc from `exists_disc_collar`. The
height of the wedge above a point of `K` is less than the distance to `Z`.
