# Open sets in which every `O`-arc bounds a closed disc

`open_disc : OpenDiscStatement`: Graph Minors VII, (4.2). Let `S` be a connected closed surface and
`Y ⊆ S` connected and open, such that every `O`-arc in `Y` bounds a closed disc in `Y`. Then `S` is a
sphere and `Y = S`, or `Y` is an open disc.

The route. By `exists_disc_merge`, `Y` is exhausted by closed discs `D₀ ⊆ D₁ ⊆ ⋯`, each in the inside
of the next. We then map them into the plane, one after the other. A map of `D_n` has as image a
closed domain of the plane, and by the Schoenflies theorem the map on the boundary of `D_n` extends to
a homeomorphism of the plane (`exists_extension_step`). So the map extends to `D_{n+1}`, and no
annulus theorem is needed. A push of the plane that is the identity on the image of `D_n` makes the
image of `D_{n+1}` contain any given ball, so the limit map is onto the plane.
