# A larger closed disc around a closed disc

Let `Δ` be a closed disc of a surface whose boundary consists of interior points of the surface. In
this file we find a closed disc `Δ'` that has `Δ` in its inside, in any neighbourhood of the boundary
of `Δ` (`exists_disc_around`).

We add caps from `Cap.lean` along the boundary of `Δ`, in two rounds. We cut the boundary into an even
number of short arcs. The first round adds a cap exactly along every second arc, so the remaining arcs
stay in the boundary. The second round adds a cap along each remaining arc, a little longer than the
arc.
