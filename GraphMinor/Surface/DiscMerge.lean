# Merging a closed disc with a chart

Let `Y` be a set of a closed surface in which every `O`-arc bounds a closed disc. `exists_disc_merge`
says that a closed disc of `Y` and a round disc of a chart in `Y` that overlap lie in a common closed
disc of `Y`, unless `Y` is a whole sphere.

The round circle of the chart meets the boundary of the disc in a wild way, so `exists_tame_pair`
first moves it a little. The new curve still goes around the centre of the chart, since a logarithm
of the coordinate on it would give two different values for the rise of the angle along its two
arcs (`not_hasLogOn_of_two_sides`). Now `exists_disc_cover` swallows the curve.

The file also shows that an `O`-arc has empty interior in a surface, and that a surface is metrizable.
