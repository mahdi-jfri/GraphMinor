# A closed disc around an arc

Every arc `L` of a closed surface lies inside a closed disc (`exists_disc_of_arc`), and this disc can be chosen with a chart that makes `L` a straight segment.

Near an arc in a chart we use the strip coordinates of `exists_straight`: the arc lies on the real axis (`exists_stripChart`). A map of the plane that is the identity on the frontier of a compact set extends to the surface by the identity (`exists_glue`).

To swallow an arc, suppose that a disc holds the first part of it. The next part lies in a chart. Slide the points of this strip to the left along the real axis, by a homeomorphism `h` of the surface that is the identity off a thin rectangle. If the rectangle is thin enough, `h` maps all of the longer arc into the disc, so the preimage under `h` of the disc holds the longer arc.
