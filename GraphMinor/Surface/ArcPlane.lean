# An arc in the plane lies on an `O`-arc

Every arc of the plane is part of an `O`-arc (`exists_closing_arc`), so by the Schoenflies theorem some homeomorphism of the plane maps it to an arc of the unit circle (`exists_straight`).

To close an arc we must reach its two ends from the outside. Take a double cover of the plane branched at the two ends: the Joukowski map `w ↦ (w + 1 / w) / 2`, after an affine change that puts the ends at `-1` and `1`. The preimage of the arc is an `O`-arc through `-1` and `1`. Each side of an `O`-arc is simple by the Schoenflies theorem, and the side that misses the pole `0` maps down to a path between the two ends that misses the rest of the arc.
