# Janiszewski's theorem and crossing sets in a disc

* `janiszewski`: if the compact sets `K₁, K₂` have a preconnected intersection and neither separates
  `a` from `b`, then their union does not separate `a` from `b`. The two logarithms given by
  Eilenberg's criterion differ by a constant on the intersection, so they paste.
* `IsClosedDisc.exists_chart`: coordinates on a closed disc, with values in the closed unit disc of
  `ℂ`.
* `disc_crossing : DiscCrossingStatement`: compact connected sets in a closed disc whose ends cross
  on the boundary meet. Rotate so that the two ends of `A` lie on a vertical line, with `b` to its
  right and `d` to its left. Let `F` be the frontier of a large half disc to the right of the line,
  so `F` is the chord together with an outer part `R`. Suppose `A` and `B` are disjoint. Then `B`
  joins `b` to `d` off the compact set `A ∪ R`, so `(z - d) / (z - b)` has a logarithm there by
  Eilenberg's criterion. On the closed unit disc minus `{b, d}` this function has an explicit
  logarithm, as both factors lie in a half plane. The two logarithms differ by a constant on the
  connected set `A`, so they paste along `a` and `c` to a logarithm on `F`. So `b` and `d` lie in
  one component of the complement of `F`, which is false since `b` lies in the half disc and `d`
  outside it. The connected set `A` replaces the chord, and no path in `A` is needed.
