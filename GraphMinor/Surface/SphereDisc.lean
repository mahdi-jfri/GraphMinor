# `O`-arcs in a sphere

`sphere_disc : SphereDiscStatement`: an `O`-arc in a sphere is the common boundary of exactly two
closed discs.

Move a point off the arc to infinity, and then use the Schoenflies theorem. This gives a homeomorphism
of the sphere onto the one-point compactification of the plane that takes the arc to the unit
circle of `ℂ` (`exists_homeomorph_model`). For the unit circle the two discs are the closed unit disc
and its image under `z ↦ 1 / z`. A closed disc with boundary the unit circle is minus its boundary an
open set, by invariance of domain in the plane obtained by removing one of its points, so it fills
one of the two sides.
