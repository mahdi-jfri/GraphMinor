# Loops on a cuff

We write the circle as the real line modulo the integers, through `ee`. A strictly increasing map `τ` of `[0, 1]` with
`τ 1 = τ 0 + 1` is a homeomorphism of the circle that preserves the orientation (`exists_circle_homeo`). So, by
`move_cuff`, a cuff can be moved along such a map (`exists_move_loop`). A loop that goes once around a cuff gives a
homeomorphism from the circle (`exists_circle_param`), and any line in the cuff lifts to a monotone map into the real
line (`exists_lift`, `lift_mono`).
