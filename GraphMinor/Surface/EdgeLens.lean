# A thin disc around a line

Let `L` be a line with ends `u, v` in a closed surface, and let `Z` be a closed set that meets `L` only at its ends. Then there is a closed disc around `L` that meets `Z` only at `u, v`, with `u, v` on its boundary and the rest of `L` inside (`exists_edge_lens`). The line cuts the disc into two sides, each connected and each with all of `L` in its closure.

We make `L` straight with `exists_stripChart`, and take the region between two graphs over `L`, of height at most half the distance to `Z`. Its image of the unit disc is `lensMap`.
