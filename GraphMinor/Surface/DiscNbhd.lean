# A point with a closed disc as a neighbourhood

A point with a closed disc as a neighbourhood is a manifold point (`isManifoldPoint_of_disc`). The chart is the
Möbius map of the closed disc without a point onto the closed right half plane. Such a point is on the boundary of the
space if it is on the boundary of the disc (`mem_bd_of_disc`).
