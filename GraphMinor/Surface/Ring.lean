# A thin disc around a disc

Let `B` be a closed disc whose boundary lies in the interior of a surface, and let `Z` be a closed set that meets `B` only on its boundary. We find a closed disc `Δ` around `B` that
meets `Z` only in `B`, and whose boundary leaves `B` at every point off `Z` (`exists_ring`). In a collar of `B` the height of `Δ` above a point of the boundary of `B` is half the
distance to `Z`.
