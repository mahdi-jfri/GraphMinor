# The Jordan curve theorem in the plane and in the sphere

This file proves `jordan_curve_theorem : JordanCurveStatement`.

The plane case carries `jordan_complex` over the isometry between `ℂ` and `EuclideanPlane`. For the
sphere, we first find a point off the `O`-arc (the sphere is not a circle, `exists_notMem_oArc`).
The sphere is homogeneous (`exists_homeomorph_onePoint`, by a reflection of $\mathbb{R}^3$), so we
may take that point to be the point at infinity of the one-point compactification. Then the arc lies
in the plane, and the sphere components are the bounded component and the unbounded component with
the point at infinity added.
