# The orientation of the plane

We orient the plane. The direction of the boundary of a closed disc `Δ` is the one that turns positively around the points inside `Δ`.

By the Schoenflies theorem a parametrization of `bd(Δ)` extends to a homeomorphism `G` of the plane. If the boundary did not turn around
`G 0`, then it would be null-homotopic off `G 0`, and `G⁻¹` would make the unit circle null-homotopic off `0`, which it is not
(`wind_ne_zero`).

The heart is `wind_eq_of_nested`. Let `Δ₁ ⊆ Δ₂` be discs and let `a, b, c` be common boundary points. Take `z` inside `Δ₁`. The arc of
`bd(Δ₁)` from `a` to `b` and the arc of `bd(Δ₂)` from `a` to `b` miss `c`. So they miss a path from `z` to `c` inside `Δ₁`, followed by a
path from `c` to a far point outside `Δ₂`. Hence the two arcs turn equally around `z`, and adding up the three pairs of arcs shows that
the two boundaries turn equally around `z`.
