# Collapsing an arc

An arc of a closed surface can be collapsed to a point by a map of the surface to itself that is homotopic to the identity (`exists_collapse`). The map is injective off the arc and onto. This is the fact "`Σ' ≅ Σ`" in the proof of Graph Minors XIX, (6.3) (page 340), for one edge.

By `exists_disc_of_arc` and the strip coordinates of `exists_stripChart`, it is enough to collapse a segment of the real axis in the closed unit ball, by a map that is the identity on the unit circle. For this we use the Joukowski map. Let `a > 1`. On the annulus `1 ≤ ‖w‖ ≤ R`, the map `j` sends `w = t u` to `(w + 1 / w) / 2` with its real part divided by `a` and its imaginary part by `b`, where `a` and `b` are the half axes of the ellipse that is the image of `‖w‖ = R`. It maps onto the unit ball, it is injective off the circle `‖w‖ = 1`, and it folds this circle onto a segment. The map `w ↦ (t - 1) / (R - 1) u` maps onto the unit ball too, and it sends this circle to `0`. So it factors through `j`, and this gives the collapse (`exists_ball_collapse`).
