# Collars of cuffs and moving a cuff

`exists_collar`: every cuff of a surface has a collar inside any neighbourhood of it. We paste a closed
disc onto the cuff (`paste_disc`), find a larger disc around this disc (`exists_disc_around`) and use
the annulus between them (`exists_disc_collar`).

`move_cuff : MoveCuffStatement`: a homeomorphism `h` of the circle that preserves the orientation is
joined to the identity by the straight homotopy of its lift to the line. We run this homotopy across the
collar, so the result is `h` on the cuff and the identity on the far end of the collar.
