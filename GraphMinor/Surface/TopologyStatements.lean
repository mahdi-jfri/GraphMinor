# The topological facts that Graph Minors VI–XIX use without proof

The papers use several theorems of plane and surface topology without proof, or with a reference
to the literature. This file states each of them as a `Prop`, in the form the papers use it, on
the definitions of `GraphMinor/Surface/Defs.lean`.

The statements, in order:
- the 2-sphere (`IsSphere`), the boundary of a closed disc (`DiscBoundaryStatement`), and cuffs
  (`CuffStatement`);
- the Jordan curve theorem (`JordanCurveStatement`) and the Schoenflies theorem
  (`SchoenfliesStatement`, `SphereDiscStatement`);
- discs: `O`-arcs and proper `I`-arcs in a closed disc (`DiscOArcStatement`, `DiscIArcStatement`),
  union and difference of discs (`DiscUnionStatement`, `DiscDifferenceStatement`), and crossing
  connected sets (`DiscCrossingStatement`);
- the model surfaces $\Sigma(a, b, c)$ (`SurfaceModel`), and their classification
  (`ClassificationStatement`, `ModelCriterionStatement`);
- cutting along arcs and pasting discs (`IsCutting`, `IsSimplerThan`, `CutIArcStatement`,
  `CutOArcStatement`, `PasteDiscStatement`, `SimplerWellFoundedStatement`);
- null-homotopic `O`-arcs (`EpsteinStatement`, `OpenDiscStatement`);
- moving points and arcs by homeomorphisms (`MoveCuffStatement`, `ParallelArcsStatement`,
  `SimilarArcsFiniteStatement`, `PushOffStatement`).

Each statement holds as written for the topological notions of `Defs.lean`. Two points differ from
the loose wording in the papers.

* Crossing connected sets: two arbitrary connected sets in a disc whose ends cross need not meet.
  With the axiom of choice one can split a disc into two disjoint dense connected sets (a
  Bernstein set and its complement). So `DiscCrossingStatement` asks for compact sets, which is
  what the papers use, and `DiscCrossingStatement.of_isPathConnected` deduces the form for
  path-connected sets.
* Parallel arcs: Graph Minors VII, (3.2), claim (1) must also ask that the homeomorphism fixes the
  ends of the arc. See `ParallelArcsStatement`.

/-! ## 1. The sphere, the boundary of a disc, and cuffs -/

/-- `S` is a *2-sphere*: homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of the plane. Mathlib's
`onePointEquivSphereOfFinrankEq` identifies this space with the unit sphere of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Graph Minors VII, Section 2 (page 213). -/
def IsSphere (S : Type u) [TopologicalSpace S] : Prop :=
  Nonempty (S ≃ₜ OnePoint EuclideanPlane)

/-- The manifold boundary of a closed disc is the image of the unit circle under every
homeomorphism from the closed unit disc onto it. This is the invariance of the boundary, and it
makes `discBd` the boundary that the papers mean. -/
def DiscBoundaryStatement : Prop :=
  ∀ {S : Type u} [TopologicalSpace S] (Δ : Set S) (φ : ClosedUnitDisc ≃ₜ Δ),
    discBd Δ = (fun x => (φ x).1) '' {x | x.1 ∈ UnitCircle}

/-- A surface has finitely many cuffs, and each of them is an `O`-arc.
Graph Minors VI, Section 1 (page 116); Graph Minors VII, Section 2 (page 213): "Every cuff is
homeomorphic to the circle $S^1$." -/

/-! ## 2. The Jordan curve theorem and the Schoenflies theorem -/

/-- `A` and `B` are the two components of the complement of `F`, and `F` is the frontier of
each. -/
def IsJordanSplit {S : Type u} [TopologicalSpace S] (F A B : Set S) : Prop :=
  A ≠ B ∧ componentsIn (univ \ F) = {A, B} ∧ frontier A = F ∧ frontier B = F

/-- **Jordan curve theorem.** The complement of an `O`-arc `F` in the plane has exactly two
components, one bounded and one unbounded, and `F` is the frontier of each. The complement of an
`O`-arc in a sphere has exactly two components, and `F` is the frontier of each.
Used in Graph Minors VI, Section 3 (pages 119–121), and throughout the later papers. -/

/-- An `O`-arc `F` in a sphere is the common boundary of exactly two closed discs. They cover the
sphere, they meet exactly in `F`, and the complement of `F` has the two components `Δ₁ \ F` and
`Δ₂ \ F`.
Graph Minors XI, Section 4 (page 79), treats the sphere separately because of these two sides. -/

      ∀ Δ : Set S, IsClosedDisc Δ → discBd Δ = F → Δ = Δ₁ ∨ Δ = Δ₂

/-! ## 3. Closed discs -/

/-- `Δ` is the closed disc inside the `O`-arc `F` of the closed disc `D`: it lies in `D`, its
boundary is `F`, and `Δ \ F` is a component of `D \ F` that misses the boundary of `D`, the only
such component. -/

    Δ \ F ∈ componentsIn (D \ F) ∧ Disjoint (Δ \ F) (discBd D) ∧
    ∀ C ∈ componentsIn (D \ F), Disjoint C (discBd D) → C = Δ \ F

/-- Every `O`-arc `F` in a closed disc `D` bounds a closed disc `Δ ⊆ D`, and `Δ` is the only closed
disc in `D` with boundary `F`. Moreover `Δ \ F` is the unique component of `D \ F` disjoint from
`bd D`. The arc `F` may meet `bd D`, or may equal it, and then `Δ = D`.

    ∃ Δ : Set S, IsInsideDisc D F Δ ∧
      ∀ Δ' : Set S, Δ' ⊆ D → IsClosedDisc Δ' → discBd Δ' = F → Δ' = Δ

/-- Let `F` be a line in the closed disc `D` with distinct ends `s, t` in `bd D` and no other point
in `bd D`. Then `bd D` minus `{s, t}` has two components `A₁, A₂`, and `F` divides `D` into two
closed discs `Δ₁, Δ₂` that meet exactly in `F`, with boundaries `A₁ ∪ F` and `A₂ ∪ F`. The set
`D \ F` has the two components `Δ₁ \ F` and `Δ₂ \ F`.

      componentsIn (D \ F) = {Δ₁ \ F, Δ₂ \ F}

/-- Two closed discs that meet exactly in a line `L` of both boundaries have a closed disc as
union. Its boundary consists of the two boundaries without the interior of `L`.
Graph Minors IX, Section 11 (page 67): "the union of $\Delta_0$ with all lawns is a closed disc";

$bd(\Delta) = F$." -/

    IsClosedDisc (Δ₁ ∪ Δ₂) ∧ discBd (Δ₁ ∪ Δ₂) = (discBd Δ₁ ∪ discBd Δ₂) \ (L \ {s, t})

/-- Let `Δ₁ ⊆ Δ₂` be closed discs whose boundaries meet exactly in a line `L`. Then
`closure (Δ₂ \ Δ₁)` is a closed disc. Its boundary consists of the two boundaries without the
interior of `L`, and it meets `Δ₁` exactly in the rest of `bd Δ₁`.
Graph Minors XI, proof of (6.1) (page 88): "If $\Delta_1 \subseteq \Delta_2$ then since
$F_1 \cap F_2 = F'$, it follows that $\Delta = \overline{\Delta_2 - \Delta_1}$ is a closed disc

/-- The pair `{a, c}` *crosses* `{b, d}` on `C`: the four points are distinct points of `C`, and

/-- Two compact connected sets in a closed disc `D` meet if their ends cross on `bd D`.
Graph Minors VI, Sections 2 and 3; Graph Minors IX, Section 1 (page 41). The sets of the papers
are paths and connected subgraphs of drawings, which are compact. For arbitrary connected sets
the statement fails (see the module docstring). -/

/-- The identifications that add `a` handles and `b` cross-caps to the sphere with holes. The
circles around centres `2i` and `2i + 1` with `i < a` are pasted to each other by the mirror map
(this map reverses the boundary orientation, so the result is a handle). Antipodal points of the
circle around centre `2a + i` with `i < b` are pasted to each other (this is a cross-cap). -/

Graph Minors VII, Section 2 (page 213); Graph Minors VIII, Section 5 (page 262); Graph Minors
XVII, Section 1 (page 163). Here we remove the interiors of `2a + b + c` discs from the sphere,
paste the boundaries of the first `2a + b` of them as in `ModelGlue`, and keep the remaining `c`

neither of $b, b'$ are zero.
Graph Minors XVII, (1.1)(ii) (page 163). The printed "$a + 2b = a' + 2b'$" is a slip: page 164
uses $2a + b$, and $\Sigma(1, 1, 0) \cong \Sigma(0, 3, 0)$ is the classical relation it must allow. -/

/-! ## 5. Cutting along arcs and pasting discs -/

/-- `X` is *simpler than* `Y`, for connected surfaces: there are $a \le a'$ and $b \le b'$ with
$X \cong \Sigma(a, b, c)$, $Y \cong \Sigma(a', b', c')$ and $4a + 2b + c < 4a' + 2b' + c'$.
Graph Minors XVII, Section 1 (page 164), second form.

The paper first gives another condition, on any representations: (i) if $b' = 0$ then $b = 0$;
(ii) $2a + b \le 2a' + b'$; (iii) $4a + 2b + c < 4a' + 2b' + c'$. It calls the two equivalent, but
they are not: $\Sigma(1, 0, 0)$ and $\Sigma(0, 2, 1)$ meet (i) to (iii), and the only representation
of $\Sigma(0, 2, 1)$ with $b' \neq 0$ has $a' = 0$. The proof of (13.4) (page 207) needs that a graph
drawn in a simpler surface can be drawn in the larger one, and this needs the second form. The first
form follows from the second, by `IsSimplerThan.conditions`. -/

`Z`, and this holds if and only if `F` is included in a closed disc that lies in `Z`. If `S` is
not a sphere, a closed disc bounded by `F` is unique.

/-! ## 7. Moving points and arcs by homeomorphisms -/

/-- A homeomorphism of the circle *preserves orientation* if it lifts to an increasing continuous
map of the real line. -/
def PreservesCircleOrientation (h : Circle ≃ₜ Circle) : Prop :=
  ∃ l : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous l ∧ StrictMono l ∧ ∀ t : ℝ, h (Circle.exp t) = Circle.exp (l t)

/-- Let `C` be a cuff of a surface `S` with arc-map `φ`, and let `h` be an orientation-preserving
homeomorphism of the circle. Then the homeomorphism $\varphi h \varphi^{-1}$ of `C` extends to a
homeomorphism of `S` that is the identity outside any given open set `U ⊇ C`, so in particular on
all other cuffs. This moves finite sets of boundary points in the same circular order onto each
other.

(2.1) ("replacing each $\Gamma_i$ by its image under a suitable homeomorphism"). -/

    ∃ α : S ≃ₜ S, (∀ x : Circle, α (φ x).1 = (φ (h x)).1) ∧ ∀ x ∉ U, α x = x

def HasNullSignature {S : Type u} [TopologicalSpace S] (α : S ≃ₜ S) : Prop :=
  ∀ (C : Set S) (φ : Circle ≃ₜ C), C ∈ cuffs S →
    ∃ h : Circle ≃ₜ Circle, PreservesCircleOrientation h ∧ ∀ x, α (φ x).1 = (φ (h x)).1

/-- Graph Minors VII, (3.2), claim (1) (page 219): if `F, F'` are proper `I`-arcs with the same
ends `s, t`, and a homeomorphism `α` with null signature maps `F` to `F'` and fixes `s` and `t`,
then `F` and `F'` are parallel: a homeomorphism fixing `bd S` pointwise maps `F` to `F'`.

The paper does not ask that `α` fixes the ends. This is needed: take an annulus with `s, t`
antipodal on one cuff, and two arcs with these ends on the two sides of the hole. A rotation by a
half turn swaps them and has null signature, yet each arc cuts off a different part of the cuff. -/

  ∀ (S : Type u) [TopologicalSpace S] (F F' : Set S) (s t : S) (α : S ≃ₜ S), IsSurface S →

    α '' F = F' → α s = s → α t = t → HasNullSignature α →
    ∃ β : S ≃ₜ S, β '' F = F' ∧ ∀ x ∈ bd S, β x = x

/-- Graph Minors VII, (3.1) (page 218): a surface has only finitely many similarity classes of
proper `I`-arcs, where two arcs are similar if a homeomorphism of the surface maps one to the
other. The paper's proof reduces this to the classification and to cutting along the arc. -/
def SimilarArcsFiniteStatement : Prop :=
  ∀ (S : Type u) [TopologicalSpace S], IsSurface S →
    ∃ 𝓕 : Set (Set S), 𝓕.Finite ∧ ∀ F : Set S, IsProperIArc F →
      ∃ F₀ ∈ 𝓕, ∃ α : S ≃ₜ S, α '' F₀ = F

/-- The step that makes a disc narrow, as a statement on surfaces: an `O`-arc that misses the chords of
some discs can be pushed off these discs by a homeomorphism of the surface that fixes the nodes. Here the
discs `D i` meet each other and the closed set `Z` only in the finite set `N`, and each disc has exactly
two points in `N`, on its boundary. The line `L i` joins these two points. Either it runs through the
interior of `D i`, and then `D i` meets `bd(Σ)` only in `N`, or it is `D i ∩ bd(Σ)`.

This is the content of the paper's "make the discs narrow" (Graph Minors XX, Section 8, page 348). -/
