# Graph Minors XX, Section 10, (10.5)

This file proves (10.5) of Graph Minors XX (`GM20.theorem_10_5_proof`, pages 355–356): for every countable
sequence $G_i$ of finite directed graphs, there exist $j > i$ such that $G_i$ is isomorphic to a
directed minor of $G_j$.

Following the proof on pages 355–356:
- Let $p = 2|E(G_1)| + |V(G_1)|$; if for some $i \ge 2$ the underlying undirected graph $G_i'$ of
  $G_i$ has a minor isomorphic to $K_p$, then $G_i$ has a directed minor isomorphic to $G_1$
  (`isDirMinorModel_of_hasCliqueMinor` in `GraphMinor/GM20/Directed.lean`).
- Otherwise, for $i \ge 2$ let $P_i = (H_i, \mu, \Delta, \phi)$ be `digraphPatchwork (G i)`, where
  $\mu(e)$ enumerates the ends of $e$ tail first, $\Delta(e) = \{N_X, K_X\}$, and $\phi(e) = ()$.
  Then each $P_i$ is a free rootless $\Omega$-patchwork (`isFree_digraphPatchwork`), so `theorem_10_4`
  gives $j > i \ge 2$ such that $P_i$ is simulated in $P_j$, and `isDirMinorModel_of_simulated` and
  `isIsoMinor_of_isDirMinorModel` turn that simulation into a directed minor.
- Finally, `wagner_conjecture_undirected_proof` follows immediately by orienting each undirected graph via
  `Digraph.ofGraph` and projecting the directed minor to the underlying undirected graphs via
  `Digraph.IsIsoMinor.toGraph`.
