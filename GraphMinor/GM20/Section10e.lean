# Graph Minors XX, Section 10: paintings from portrayals

The proof of (10.3) starts with a portrayal from Graph Minors XVII, whose painting has no marches of
cells. This file makes it a painting in the sense of Graph Minors XX. The one fact that needs proof is
that `c̃ ⊆ N(Γ)` for a cell `c`. If `x ∈ c̃` were not a node, then `c ∪ {x}` would be a larger arcwise
connected subset of `U(Γ) \ N(Γ)` (`isPathConnected_of_ball_subset`).
