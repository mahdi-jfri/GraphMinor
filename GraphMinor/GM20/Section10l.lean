# Graph Minors XX, (10.3)

This file proves (10.3), from (14.2) of Graph Minors XVII and the results of Section 8, 9 and 11 of that
paper. The proof takes the portrayal given by (14.2) and uses Section10f-Section10i.

The paper says that the set `𝒮` of graded surfaces with at most `q` cuffs, in which `H` cannot be drawn,
and with `ρ ≤ p`, "is finite up to homeomorphism". We state this for surfaces as
`FiniteSurfaceTypesStatement`, and we prove it from the classification of surfaces: by `Draw8` a surface
of large genus has a drawing of `H`, and by `Draw10` a surface with few cuffs is a model with small `c`.
The gradings are counted here.

/-- For a graph `H` and an integer `q`, the connected surfaces with at most `q` cuffs in which `H`
cannot be drawn are finite in number up to homeomorphism. (Graph Minors XX, Section 10, page 354:
"Thus `𝒮` is finite up to homeomorphism.") It follows from the classification of surfaces, since a
surface of large genus has a drawing of `H`. -/

/-- `FiniteSurfaceTypesStatement` holds. By the classification of surfaces, a connected surface `S` is
homeomorphic to some model `Σ(a, b, c)`. If `a` or `b` is large then `H` can be drawn in the model, and
so in `S`. A model has at least `c` cuffs, so `c` is at most the number of cuffs of `S`. So there are
finitely many possible triples `(a, b, c)`, and for each we keep one surface homeomorphic to the
model, if there is one. -/

/-- Graph Minors XX, (10.3) (page 354): "For every graph* $H$ *there exist* $\theta \ge 1$ *and a set* $\mathcal{S}$ *of graded
surfaces, finite up to homeomorphism, with the following property. Let* $P = (G, \mu,
\Delta)$ *be a rootless free patchwork, and let* $\mathcal{T}$ *be a tangle in* $G$ *of
order* $\ge \theta$ *controlling no* $H$*-minor of* $sk(G)$. *Then there exist* $W \subseteq
V(G)$ *with* $|W| < \theta$ *and a fine rooted location* $\mathcal{L}$ *in* $G/W$, *such
that* * $(P/W, \mathcal{L})$ *is* $(\Sigma, \rho)$*-shelled for some* $(\Sigma, \rho) \in
\mathcal{S}$, *and* * $\mathcal{L}$ *is linked to* $\mathcal{T}/W$." Here `𝒮` is a finite set of
representatives, and the order `θ` is at least `z + 6p + 9`, so that the standing hypotheses of Sections
8, 9, 11 of Graph Minors XVII hold. -/
