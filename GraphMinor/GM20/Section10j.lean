# Graph Minors XX, Section 10: paintings move along homeomorphisms

The set `𝒮` of (10.3) is finite only up to homeomorphism. So the proof needs that a homeomorphism
`ψ : Σ → Σ'` carries a shelled patchwork over `Σ` to one over `Σ'`. This file carries a painting and its
3-connectivity. Every notion here is topological, and each lemma says that `ψ` respects one of them.
